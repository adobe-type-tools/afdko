 Methods:
 - if the -rp option is used without a file name, read input from
    'current.fpr', and always save the final set of options.
 - if the -rp option is used with a file name, use those options,
    but save the final option.
 - save the current options only if requested with -sp, or if the
    file did not exist before.
 - override all options from a project file with any other options
    that are specified.
 - if the input font is not specified, look for, in order, 'font.ufo,
 'font.pfa', and cidfont.ps, all in the current directory.
 - if the FontMenuNameDB file is not specified look in:
    1) the current directory
    2) one up from the current
    3) two up from the current directory
    4) in FDK/Tools/SharedData/
 - if the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file is not specified look in:

-f <input font>         Specify input font path. Default is to search
                for 'font.ufo, 'font.pfa', and cidfont.ps, all in the
                current directory.
-o <output font>        Specify output font path. Default is
                '<PostScript-Name>.otf'.
-b                      Set style to Bold. Affects style-linking.
                Default is not bold
-nb                     Turn off the -b option, if it has previously
                been turned on.
-i                      Set style to Italic. Affects style-linking.
                Default is not Italic
-ni                     Turn off the -i option, if it has previously
                been turned on.
-ff <feature file>      Specify path to feature file. Default is 'features'.
-fs                     If there are no glyph substitution rules in
                the features file, make a stub GSUB table.
-mf <FontMenuNameDB>    Specify path to FontMenuNameDB file. Default
                is 'FontMenuNameDB'.
-gf <GOADB>             Specify path to GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.
                Default is 'GlyphOrderAndAliasDB'. If this is
                specified, and the -r or -ga options are NOT
                specified, the effect is to use the Unicode
                assignments from the third column of the GOADB
                file without renaming the glyphs.
-r                      Set release mode. This turns on subroutinization,
                applies the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file, and
                removes the word "Development" from the name
                table Version (name.ID=5) string.
-nr                     sets the option option -r off, if it has been
                previously set.
-S                      Turn on subroutinization, a form of
                compression of the CFF font data.
-nS                     Turn off subroutinzation, if it has
                previously been turned on.
-maxs <number>          Limits the number of subroutines generated by
                glyph subroutinization to the number. Used for
                testing with rasterizers that don't process
                subroutinization correctly.
-ga                     Applies the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.
-nga                    Turn off the -ga option, if it has previously

                GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.
                Only works if -ga or -r is set.

-rev [version]          Without the optional version number, increments the
                version number by 5. With an integer argument,
                it increments the minor version by that
                number. With a fractional argument, it sets
                the version to the fractional argument; the
                number must then be decimal with three decimal
                places, e.g. '1.045', not '1.45'.
-oldNameID4             Set Windows name.ID=4 to the PS name, and Mac
                name.ID=4 to Preferred Family + space +
                Preferred Style name, as in all releases of
                MakeOTF before Dec 2010.
-newNameID4             Set Windows and Mac name.ID=4 to Preferred
                Family + space + Preferred Style name, as in
                the current OpenType spec. This is the default
                behavior, and is needed only to override a
                fontinfo or project file setting.
-osbOn <number>         Set a bit to 'on' in the OS/2 table
                fsSelection field at the specified bit index.
-osbOff <number>        Set a bit to 'off' in the OS/2 table
                fsSelection field at the specified bit index.
                Note: if any of the bits 7,8,9 are set on or
                off, they must all three be explicitly
                set. See "New OS/2 Bits" in the
                "MakeOTFUserGuide.pdf" file.
-osv <number>           Set the OS/2 table version to the specified
                value. Must be greater than 0. If no bits >6
                are specified for the OS/2 table fsSelection
                field, then the default version number is 3;
                else the default is 4.
-addn                   Replace the .notdef glyph in the source data
                (if any) with a standard notdef glyph,
                matching font weight and width.
-naddn                  Turn off the -addn option, if it has previously
                been turned on.
-adds                   If the font is missing any of the Apple Mac
                Symbol glyphs, create them, matching the font
                weight and width.
                Will be disabled for fonts without both a zero
                and a lowercase 'x'.
-nadds                  Turn off the -adds option, if it has previously
                been turned on.
-serif                  Specify that any added glyph use the serif
                built-in multiple master glyph data.
-sans                   Specify that any added glyphs will use the
                sans-serif built-in multiple master glyph data.
-cs                     Override the heuristics, and specify the
                ScriptID for the Macintosh 'cmap' subtable;
                CID-keyed fonts only.
-cl                     Override the heuristics, and specify the
                LanguageID for the Macintosh 'cmap' subtable;
                CID-keyed fonts only.
-cm <path>              Path to the Macintosh CMap resource; CID-keyed
                fonts only.
-ch <path>              Path to the UTF-32 CMap resource for horizontal
                glyphs; CID-keyed fonts only.
-ci <path>              Path to the Unicode Variation Sequences
                specification file; if present, a 'cmap'
                subtable will be added with PlatformID = 0,
                ScriptID = 5, and Format = 14. See MakeOTF User's Guide.
-dbl                    For a short list of glyphs, double map them to
                two Unicode values if there is no other glyph
                mapped from the same Unicode value. This used to
                be default behavior for makeotf. The glyph
                list is as follows:

                Delta (U+2206, U+0394)
                Omega (U+2126, U+03A9)
                Scedilla (U+015E, U+F6C1)
                Tcommaaccent (U+0162, U+021A)
                fraction (U+2044, U+2215)
                hyphen (U+002D, U+00AD)
                macron (U+00AF, U+02C9)
                mu (U+00B5, U+03BC)
                periodcentered (U+00B7, U+2219)
                scedilla (U+015F, U+F6C2)
                space (U+0020, U+00A00)
                tcommaaccent (U+0163, U+021B)

-dcs                    Set OS/2.DefaultChar to the Unicode value for
                'space' rather than '.notdef'. The latter is
                correct by the OT spec, but QuarkXPress 6.5
                requires the former in order to print OTF/CFF
                fonts.
-fi [<path>]            Path to the fontinfo file. If no path is given,
                the default is to look for first 'fontinfo', then
                'cidfontinfo', in the current directory. Used
                to set some default values. This are
                overridden by any conflicting settings in the
                project file and then by command-line options.
                This option is processed before any others, so
                if the path is relative, it is relative to the
                current working directory. All other relative
                paths are relative so the source font's parent
                directory.
-fp [<path>]            Path to the project file. If no path is given,
                the default is 'current.fpr'; If used, it sets
                default options that can be overridden by
                command-line options.
-sp [<path>]            Save the current options to the project file
                named in the "-fp" option; not needed unless
                you specified a name other than 'current.fpr'.
                If you supply the optional path argument, then
                options are saved to that file.
-cn                     As a post-processing step, convert the CFF
                table to a CID-keyed CFF that specifies the
                Adobe-Identity-0 ROS. The resulting font
                should be considered experimental, and may not
                work in some applications.
-ncn                    Turn off converting the CFF table to a CID-keyed
                CFF that specifies the Adobe-Identity-0 ROS;
                otherwise has no effect.
-shw/-nshw              Do/Do Not suppress warnings about unhinted glyphs.
                This is useful when processing unhinted fonts.
-swo/-nswo              Suppress CFF width optimization (use of defaultWidthX
                and nominalWidthX). Useful when poking at charstrings
                with other  tools.
-stubCmap4              Build only a "stub" Format 4 'cmap' subtable, with
                only two segments. This is useful only for special-
                purpose fonts such as AdobeBlank, whose size is an
                issue. Windows requires a Format 4 'cmap' subtable
                to be present, but it is not used.

-omitMacNames/useMacNames   Write only Windows platform menu names in name
table,
                apart from the names specified in the feature file.
                -useMacNames writes Mac as well as Windows names.

-overrideMenuNames      Allow feature file name table entries to override
                default values and the values from the font menu name DB
                for name IDs. Name ID's 2 and 6 cannot be overridden.
                Use this with caution, and make sure you have provided
                feature file name table entries for all platforms.

-skco/nskco             do/do not suppress kern class optimization by using
                left side class 0 for non-zero kern values. Optimizing saves
                a few hundred to thousand bytes, but confuses some programs.
                Optimizing is the default behavior, and previously was
                the only option.
-addDSIG,-omitDSIG      Add or omit minimal empty DSIG table. This is added
                by default in release mode.
-V                      Show warnings about common, but usually not
                problematic issues, such a glyph being unhinted,
                or having conflicting GDEF classes because it is used in
                more than one class type in a layout table. An example
                is being used as a base glyph in one replacement rule,
                and as a mark glyph in another.
-v                      Print the tool's version.
-showFinal              In error messages, show glyph final name rather
                than source name.
-debug                  Turn on debug mode: does not delete temporary files.

Note that options are applied in the order in which they are
specified: "-r -nS" will not subroutinize a font, but "-nS -r" will
subroutinize a font. See the document 'MakeOTFUserGuide.pdf' for the
format and contents of the fontinfo and project files.

__help__ = __usage__ + """
MakeOTF parts.

MakeOTF now comes in two parts. One is the C program 'makeotfexe',
which requires that all input files be specified as command-line
parameters.  This is the program that reads in all the data, and build
the final OpenType font. You can build OpenType fonts using only this
program.

The other part is the 'MakeOTF.py' Python script, which is invoked
indirectly by the command-shell script 'makeotf'. The script is a
wrapper for the 'makeotfexe', and does several useful things for you:

- Uses the 'tx' tool to convert the input font into the Unix Type 1
  format that is required by 'makeotfexe'.
- Saves the parameters used for makeotfexe in a project file. This can
  later be referenced by the single option '-fp', which saves a lot of
  typing. It also allows saving standard settings for release end
  development builds.
- verifies that the input files exist. This avoids crashes in
  makeotfexe.

Project files.

Every time you run makeotf, it saves the options used to build the
font in a project file named "current.fpr". You can build the font
again with exactly the same options by using the option -fp, or use
most of the options by following '-fp' with additional options to set
different parameters.

Note that if you specify a project file other than "current.fpr", the
final set of parameters used will not be saved to the project file
unless you also specify the "-sp" option.
