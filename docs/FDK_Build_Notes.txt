FDK Build Notes

v1.2.0 July 18 2019

1) FDK build directory tree.

The FDK build directory tree is pretty straightforward.

The basic structure is:
afdko/c/
	<component>/
			build/
				<platform>/<compiler>/<debug|release>
			exe/
				<platform>/<debug|release>
			source/


When a tool uses a library, then the project for the main tool contains the projects for all the libraries. The libraries are grouped under the main directory:
	<component>/
		<library group name>/
			build/
			lib/
			api/
			source/
with sub-directories for build/ and lib/ being the same as for the program build/ and exe/ directories.

Special cases.

tx, mergefonts, and rotatefont share a common set of libraries and resource files. These libraries are grouped under the public directory in:
afdko/c/public/lib/
			build/
			lib/
			api/
			resource/
			source/


For MacOS, all programs are built with Xcode 9.4
For Windows, all programs are built with MSVC 14.0
For Linux, programs are built with gcc on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

2) FDK distribution package.

The FDK distribution directory tree is built by:

2.1) building all programs with the script afdko/c/buildall.sh (Mac), afdko/c/buildall.cmd (Windows), afdko/c/buildalllinux.sh (Linux).

2.2) deleting the Programs directory and any unused programs and files (e.g Tools/osx and Tools/Linux under Windows).


3) Testing/building systems.

The command-line tools are all implemented as either binary C programs or shell scripts. Each shell script 1) finds the Python included in the FDK and then 2) uses that Python to run a specific Python script with appropriate options.

All the commands will work only if the path FDK/Tools/osx|win|linux is added to the current users PATH environment variable.

If your primary system is Mac OSX, then a useful approach is to use VMWare Fusion (or Virtualbox) to make virtual machines. For Linux:
- download the Ubuntu Linux 64 bit iso file (x86).
- make a new VM machine with VMWare Fusion: select the iso file as the source
- install all updates
- use the Settings->Share option to share the FDK source tree on your Mac OSX file system.
- choose the VMWare Fusion menu option "VM Machine->Install VMWare Tools"
This mounts an iso file in the Linux VM. Copy the contents to a local folder in the Ubuntu Linux system. Decompress the tar file, look inside for vmware-install.pl. Run this with sudo, take default answer for all.
Do not /usr/bin/vmware-user at the end - you don't need additional X Windows support.
Get the packages needed to build:
sudo apt-get install python3.6  (NOTE: for Ubuntu 16.04 or older you may need to add a PPA such as https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa in order to get Python 3.6)
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev # gets you the zlib.h file.
