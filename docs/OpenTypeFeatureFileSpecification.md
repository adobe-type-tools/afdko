## 1. Introduction

An OpenType feature file is a text file that contains the typographic layout
feature specifications for an OpenType font in an easy-to-read format. It may
also contain override values for certain fields in the font tables. It is read
in during the creation or editing of an OpenType font. This document specifies
the feature file grammar.

This is an example of a complete feature file:

```fea
# Script and language coverage
languagesystem DFLT dflt;
languagesystem latn dflt;

# Ligature formation
feature liga {
    substitute f i by f_i;
    substitute f l by f_l;
} liga;

# Kerning
feature kern {
    position A Y -100;
    position a y -80;
    position s f' <0 0 10 0> t;
} kern;
```

This file specifies the formation of the “f_i” and “f_l” ligatures, and the kern
values of the glyph pairs “A” “Y” and “a” “y”. It also specifies a contextual
positioning adjustment for “f” when preceded by “s” and followed by “t”. It also
specifies that all features will be applied under all languages in the latn
script, and for all scripts not named in the feature file.

**Note:** All “Implementation Notes” and “Currently not implemented” comments
in the rest of the specification below refer to the Adobe implementation of the
feature file grammar in the makeotf program, unless otherwise indicated.

<a name="2"></a>
## 2. Syntax

<a name="2.a"></a>
### 2.a. Comments

The `#` character indicates the start of a comment; the comment extends until
the end of the line. Text on a line after the comment is discarded before
processing.

<a name="2.b"></a>
### 2.b. White space

White space is not significant except for delimiting tokens. You can have
multiple line endings, spaces, and tabs between tokens. Macintosh, UNIX and PC
line endings are all supported.

<a name="2.c"></a>
### 2.c. Keywords

This is a complete list of keywords in the feature file language. Note that all
keywords have a global scope. Although many keywords may be used only in
specific contexts, the same keyword is never used in different ways in different
contexts.

<a name="2.e"></a>
## 2.e. Numbers and other metrics

<a name="2.e.i"></a>
#### 2.e.i. Number

A `<number>` is a signed decimal integer (without leading zeros). For example:

    -150
    1000

It is used in device tables [§[2.e.iii](#2.e.iii)] and contour points
[§[2.e.vi](#2.e.vi)], as well as the values of various table fields [§[9](#9)].

<a name="2.e.ii"></a>
#### 2.e.ii. Metric

A `<metric>` value is simply a `<number>` in font design units. It is used in
value records [§[2.e.iv](#2.e.iv)] for positioning rules, as well as to express
the values of various table fields [§[9](#9)].

_[ Note: Multiple master support has been withdrawn as of OpenType specification 1.3. ]_

<a name="2.e.iii"></a>
#### 2.e.iii. Device table _[ Currently not implemented. ]_

A `<device>` represents a single device table or a null offset to it. It is used
in value records [§[2.e.iv](#2.e.iv)], anchors [§[2.e.vii](#2.e.vii)], and
the GDEF table LigatureCaret statements [§[9.b](#9.b)].

##### Device format A:

This specifies a comma-separated list of `<number>` pairs. The first `<number>`
in a pair represents a ppem size and the second the number of pixels to adjust
at that ppem size:

```fea
<device <number> <number>,   # ppem size, number of pixels to adjust
       (<number> <number>)>; # zero or more such pairs
```

For example:

```fea
<device 11 -1, 12 -1>  # Adjust by -1 at 11 ppem and 12 ppem
```

##### Device format B, the null device:

```fea
<device NULL>
```

This format is used when an undefined `<device>` is needed in a list of `<device>` tables.

<a name="2.e.iv"></a>
#### 2.e.iv. Value record

A `<valuerecord>` is used in some positioning rules [§[6](#6)].

Except for format A, a `<valuerecord>` must be enclosed by angle brackets.
Note that the `<metric>` adjustments indicate values (in
design units) to add to (positive values) or subtract from (negative values) the
placement and advance values provided in the font (in the `hmtx` and `vmtx`
tables).

##### Value record format A:

```fea
<metric>  # Angle brackets around value are not allowed.
```

Here the `<metric>` represents an x advance adjustment, except when used in the
`vkrn`, `vpal`, `vhal`, or `valt` features, in which case it represents a y
advance adjustment. All other adjustments are implicitly set to 0. This is the
simplest feature file `<valuerecord>` format, and is provided since it
represents the most commonly used adjustment (i.e. for kerning). For example:

```fea
-3  # without <>
```

Note that the use of a single value as y advance can only be triggered when the
value record definition is contained within a `vkrn`, `vpal`, `vhal`, or `valt`
feature definition. If it is in a standalone lookup, then the value will be
interpreted as an x advance, even if the lookup is referenced from within one of
the vertical metric features.

##### Value record format B:

```fea
<<metric> <metric> <metric> <metric>>
```

Here, the `<metric>` values represent adjustments for x placement, y placement, x
advance, and y advance, in that order. For example:

```fea
<-80 0 -160 0>       # x placement adjustment: -80; x advance adjustment: -160
```

##### Value record format C: _[ Currently not implemented. ]_

```fea
<<metric> <metric> <metric> <metric> <device> <device> <device> <device>>
```

Here, the `<metric>` values represent the same adjustments as in format B. The
`<device>` values represent device tables [§[2.e.iii](#2.e.iii)] for x placement, y
placement, x advance, and y advance, in that order. This format lets the editor
express the full functionality of an OpenType value record. For example:

```fea
<-80 0 -160 0 <device 11 -1, 12 -1>
              <device NULL>

              <device 11 -2, 12 -2>
              <device NULL>>
```

This example specifies adjustments for x placement and x advance, as well as
device adjustments at 11 and 12 ppem sizes for x placement and x advance.

##### Value record format D, the null value record: _[ Currently not implemented. ]_

```fea
<NULL> # Value record not defined
```

##### Value record format E, the named value record:

```fea
<name>
```

For example:

```fea
<KERN_POS_1>
```

The name must have been defined with a `valueRecordDef` statement before being used.

<a name="2.e.v"></a>
#### 2.e.v. Named value record

The `valueRecordDef` keyword is used to define a named value record. This name
can then be used in value records instead of coordinates. It offers the
advantage of being able to change the coordinates in the named value record
definition only, and having that single edit change the coordinates used in all
the rules in which the named value record is used. The format is:

```fea
valueRecordDef <coordinates> name;
```

where the coordinates can be in value record formats A or B. The anchor name
follows the same rules as are used to form glyph names. For example:

```fea
valueRecordDef -10 FIRST_KERN;
valueRecordDef <0 0 20 0> SECOND_KERN;
```

These named value coordinates can then be used in value records. For example:

```fea
pos T V <SECOND_KERN>;
```

Note that when the value record name is used, it must be enclosed by angle
brackets, whether it is a single value or four value record. The
`valueRecordDef` is a top level statement, and must be defined outside of
feature blocks. It also must be defined before it is used.

<a name="2.e.vi"></a>
#### 2.e.vi. Contour point

A `<contour point>` is used in anchors [§[2.e.vii](#2.e.vii)] and the GDEF table
LigatureCaret statements [§[9.b](#9.b)]. It takes the format:

```fea
contourpoint <number>
```

where `<number>` specifies a contour point index. For example:

```fea
contourpoint 2
```

**Note:** Since OpenType-CFF fonts do not specify contour point indexes, a
`<contour point>` may be used only with TrueType OpenType fonts.

<a name="2.e.vii"></a>
#### 2.e.vii. Anchor

An `<anchor>` is used in some positioning rules [§[6](#6)]. It takes 5 formats:

##### Anchor format A:

```fea
<anchor <metric> <metric>>  # x coordinate, y coordinate
```

For example:

```fea
<anchor 120 -20>
```

##### Anchor format B:

```fea
<anchor <metric> <metric>  # x coordinate, y coordinate
        <contour point>>
```

For example:

```fea
<anchor 120 -20 contourpoint 5>
```

##### Anchor format C:

```fea
<anchor <metric> <metric>   # x coordinate, y coordinate
        <device> <device>>  # x coordinate device, y coordinate device
```

For example:

```fea
<anchor 120 -20 <device 11 1> <device NULL>>
```

##### Anchor format D, the null anchor:

```fea
<anchor NULL> # Anchor not defined
```

##### Anchor format E, the named anchor:

```fea
<anchor <name>>
```

For example:

```fea
<anchor TOP_ANCHOR_1>
```

An anchor name must be defined before it is used – see the following section on
the `anchorDef` keyword.

<a name="2.e.viii"></a>
#### 2.e.viii. Named anchor definition

The `anchorDef` keyword is used to define a named anchor. This name can then be
used in anchor definitions instead of coordinates. It offers the advantage of
being able to change the coordinates in the named anchor definition only, and
having that single edit change the coordinates used in all the rules in which
the named anchor is used. The format is:

```fea
anchorDef <coordinates> <name>;
```

where the coordinates can be in Anchor Format A or B. The anchor name follows
the same rules as are used to form glyph names. For example:

```fea
anchorDef 300 0 ANCHOR_1;
anchorDef 120 -20 contourpoint 5 ANCHOR_2;
```

These named anchors can then be used in anchor definitions. For example:

```fea
<anchor ANCHOR_2>
```

<a name="2.f"></a>
### 2.f. Glyphs

These are represented by one of:

<a name="2.f.i"></a>
#### 2.f.i. Glyph name

There are two different contexts for glyph naming: final production names and
development names.

For production glyph names, names that are used in shipping font files, the
specification is set by the PostScript and Type1 specifications, which define
what is expected by existing PostScript interpreters. These limitations are as
follows.

A glyph name may be up to 63 characters in length, must be entirely comprised of
characters from the following set:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    0123456789
    .  # period
    _  # underscore

and must not start with a digit or period. The only exception is the special
character “.notdef”.

“twocents”, “a1”, and “\_” are valid glyph names. “2cents” and “.twocents” are
“not.

Development glyph names, names used in source data during the development of a
font, have a larger supported character set. In addition to the characters
allowed for production glyph names, the following characters must also be
supported for development glyph names:

    U+002A * Asterisk
    U+002B + Plus sign
    U+002D - Hyphen-minus
    U+003A : Colon
    U+005E ^ Circumflex accent
    U+007C | Vertical bar
    U+007E ~ Tilde

However, none of these characters are allowed at the start of a glyph name.

For glyphs where the development glyph name differs from the final production
glyph name, an implementation of the feature file syntax must be able to accept
either name in source files, but must produce output data which contains either
only development glyph names or only final production glyph names.

A glyph name alias database may be used by the implementation of the feature
file grammar to map from development glyph names in the source font data to
final production glyph names. If it is used, then it is the responsibility of
the implementation to correlate the development glyph names used in the feature
file with the final glyph names in the font.

In order disambiguate whether a text token is a range argument or a glyph name
which contains a hyphen, the implementation should first assume that the token
is a glyph name. If there is no glyph in the source data with a name that
matches the token, then the implementation should interpret the token as a range
argument.

An initial backslash serves to differentiate a glyph name from an identical
keyword in the feature file language. (See §[2.c](#2.c) for a list of keywords.)
For example, a glyph named “table” must be specified in the feature file as:

```fea
\table
```

<a name="2.f.ii"></a>
#### 2.f.ii. CID

CIDs are represented by a non-negative `<number>` [§[2.e.i](#2.e.i)] preceded by
a backslash. For example:

```fea
\101
\0
```

<a name="2.g"></a>
### 2.g. Glyph classes

**Note:** The feature file glyph classes described in this section are not to be
confused with glyph classes of OpenType Layout ClassDefs. The latter are
described in the chapter [“Common Table Formats”](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/chapter2)
in the OpenType specification.

A feature file glyph class, `<glyphclass>`, represents a single glyph position
in a sequence and is denoted by a list of glyphs enclosed in square brackets.
For example:

```fea
[endash emdash figuredash]
```

An example of a sequence which contains a glyph class is:

```fea
space [endash emdash figuredash] space
```

This would match any of the 3 sequences “space endash space”, “space emdash
space”, or “space figuredash space” during OpenType layout.

A feature file glyph class that contains only one single glyph is known as a
singleton glyph class.

A feature file glyph class is also used to represent the set of alternate glyphs
in an alternate substitution lookup type rule.

<a name="2.g.i"></a>
#### 2.g.i. Ranges

A glyph range is a notational mechanism in the feature file grammar that makes it
possible to define a class of several glyphs is a concise way. The mechanism makes
use of glyph names that use a contiguous alphabetic sequence A to Z or a to z (or
sub-sequences thereof), or that use contiguous numeric sequences, such as 0 to 9. A
range is specified by referencing starting and ending glyph names, and all of the
glyph names in the implied sequence are included in the class. The glyphs referenced
by these names do not have to be in a contiguous sequence in a font file or sources;
only their names need to be in a contiguous sequence.

If a glyph name within the implied sequence does not correspond to a glyph in the font
file or font sources, it is ignored.

A range of glyphs is denoted by a hyphen:

```fea
[<firstGlyph> - <lastGlyph>]
```

Spaces around the hyphen are not required, so these are also valid ranges:

```fea
[\0-\31]
[A-Z]
```

For CID fonts, the ordering is the CID ordering.

For non-CID fonts, the ordering is independent of the ordering of glyphs in the
font. `<firstGlyph>` and `<lastGlyph>` must be the same length and can differ only
in one of the following ways:

1.  By a single letter from A-Z, either uppercase or lowercase. For example:

    ```fea
    [A.swash - Z.swash]
    [a - z]
    ```

    The range is expanded by incrementing the letter that differs, while keeping
    the rest of the glyph name the same.

2.  By up to 3 decimal digits in a contiguous run. For example:

    ```fea
    [ampersand.01 - ampersand.58]
    ```

    The range is expanded by incrementing the number values, while keeping the rest
    of the glyph name the same.

    ```fea
    [ampersand.1 - ampersand.58]  # invalid
    ```

    is not a valid glyph class since the length of the glyph names differ.

Note that

```fea
[zero - nine]
```

is not a valid glyph range, as the intended range is not in alphabetic order. It
must be enumerated explicitly:

```fea
@digits = [zero one two three four five six seven eight nine];
```

<a name="2.g.ii"></a>
#### 2.g.ii. Named glyph classes

A glyph class can be named by assigning it to a glyph class name, which begins
with the “@” character, and then referred to later on by the glyph class name.
For example:

```fea
@dash = [endash emdash figuredash];     # Assignment
space @dash space                       # Usage
```

The part of the glyph class name after the “@” is subject to the same name
restrictions that apply to a production glyph name except that hyphens are
also allowed.

Glyph class assignments can appear anywhere in the feature file. A glyph class
name may be used in the feature file only after its definition.

When a glyph class name occurs within square brackets, its elements are simply
added onto the other elements in the glyph class being defined. For example:

```fea
@Vowels.lc = [a e i o u];
@Vowels.uc = [A E I O U];
@Vowels = [@Vowels.lc @Vowels.uc y Y];
```

Here the last statement is equivalent to:

```fea
@Vowels = [a e i o u A E I O U y Y];
```

No square brackets are needed if a glyph class name is assigned to another
single glyph class name. For example:

```fea
@Figures_lining_tabular = @FIGSDEFAULT;
```

Ranges, glyphs, and glyph class names can be combined in a glyph class.
For example:

```fea
[A.oldstyle - Z.oldstyle ampersand.oldstyle  @smallCaps]
```

**Implementation note:** When feature file glyph sequences (including glyph
classes) are converted into OpenType Layout ClassDefs or Coverages in the font,
the Adobe implementation ensures that ClassDefs or Coverages that are identical
are shared, even if they are in different features. This happens regardless of
whether ranges, glyphs or glyph class names were used to express the feature
file glyph classes. (The only exception to this is for lookups that use the
Extension lookup types: such lookups will not share their ClassDefs and
Coverages with non-extension lookups.)

<a name="2.h"></a>
### 2.h. Tags

Tags are four-letter identifiers. These are denoted simply by tag name, without
any final spaces, and are distinguished from glyph names by context. For
example:

```fea
DEU
```

Note that the final space in the example is implicit.

A tag can only have characters from the following set:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    0123456789
    .  # period
    _  # underscore
    !  # Exclamation point
    $  # Dollar sign
    %  # Percent sign
    &  # Ampersand
    *  # Asterisk
    +  # Plus sign
    :  # Colon
    ?  # Question mark
    ^  # Caret
    '  # Back-quote
    |  # Vertical bar
    ~  # Tilde

and must not start with a digit or hyphen. However, use of characters beyond
those in production glyph names is not recommended.

The keyword `mark` is a valid tag but other (short) keywords are not.  The
special language tag `dflt` denotes the default language system of the
corresponding script.

<a name="2.i"></a>
### 2.i. Lookup block labels

The same length and name restrictions that apply to a production glyph name
apply to a lookup block label.  For historical reasons the keyword `mark' also
accepted as a label but other keywords are not.

<a name="3"></a>
## 3. Including files

Including files is indicated by the directive:

```fea
include(<filename>);
```

For example:

```fea
include(../family.fea);
```

An include directive is valid in any context that otherwise contains statements
ending in semicolons: "Top-level" statements; `feature`, `lookup`, `table`,
`cvParameter`, and `AxisValue` blocks; and `name` groups. (An implementation
that processes include statements at the token level is not required to enforce
these restrictions.)

The implementation software is responsible for handling the search paths for the
location of the included files.

Because of variations in implementations over time, a relative include path
should be resolved in the order described below; the first which matches should
be used.

1.  If the source font is UFO format, then relative to the UFO’s font directory
2.  relative to the top-level include file
3.  relative to the parent include file

A maximum include depth of 50 ensures against infinite include loops (files that
include each other).

<a name="4"></a>
## 4. Specifying features

<a name="4.a"></a>
### 4.a. feature

Each feature is specified in a feature block:

```fea
feature <feature tag> {
    # specifications go here
} <feature tag>;
```

For example:

```fea
feature liga {
    # ...
} liga;
```

The `aalt` feature is treated specially; see §[8.a](#8.a). For example, the
`useExtension` keyword may optionally precede `{` in its feature block syntax,
and other features can be referred to with a `feature` statement within its
feature block. The `size` feature is also treated specially; see §[8.b](#8.b).

A feature file “rule” is a statement that specifies glyph substitution or
glyph positioning. A feature block may contain glyph substitution rules
[§[5](#5)], glyph positioning rules [§[6](#6)], or both.

A lookup is a group of rules of the same type. See §[4.e](#4.e).

<a name="4.b"></a>
### 4.b. Language system

An OpenType language system is any combination of a script tag
and a language tag. (In the text of this document, the notation `<script
tag>`/`<language tag>` is used to refer to a language system; for example,
`script latn`/`language dflt` denotes the default language of the Latin script.)

The lookups in every OpenType feature must be registered under
one or more language systems. The lookups of a particular feature may vary across
the language systems under which the feature is registered.

There are two ways to specify language system in the feature
file: with the `languagesystem` keyword outside of feature definition blocks,
and by the `script` and `language` keywords within feature definition blocks.

<a name="4.b.i"></a>
#### 4.b.i. languagesystem

In practice, most or all of the features in a font will be registered under the
same set of language systems, and a particular feature’s lookups will be
identical across the language systems under which the feature is registered.

The `languagesystem` statement provides a simple directive to use in this case.
It is the simplest way to specify language system in the feature file. (For the
`aalt` and `size` features, it is the only way to specify language system.) One
or more such statements may be present in the feature file at global scope (i.e.
outside of the feature blocks or any other blocks) and before any of the feature
blocks:

```fea
languagesystem <script tag> <language tag>;
```

When these statements are present, then all the lookups in each feature that
does not contain an explicit `script` or `language` statement (see
[4.b.ii](#4.b.ii) below) will be registered under every language system
specified by the `languagesystem` statement(s). If a feature block does contain
`script` or `language` tags, then all lookups that occur before the first
`script` or `language` tag will also be applied under all the specified
language systems.

If no `languagesystem` statement is present, then the implementation must behave
exactly as though the following statement were present at the beginning of the
feature file:

```fea
languagesystem DFLT dflt;
```

If any `languagesystem` statement is used, then the statement specifying:

```fea
languagesystem DFLT dflt;
```

must be specified explicitly; if not, this language system will not be included
in the font. This `script`/`language` pair is special: it is used if a program
cannot find a match in the font to the current writing script and language.
If it is not in your font, then all the rules may be invisible to the program
if your font does not have a match for the current script and language.
It is strongly recommended to use the statement `languagesystem DFLT dflt;`.

If the statement `languagesystem DFLT dflt;` is present, it must be the first
of the `languagesystem` statements. Any other `language` statements using the
`DFLT` script tag must precede all other `language` statements.

Please see example 1 in §[4.h](#4.h) below.

<a name="4.b.ii"></a>
#### 4.b.ii. script and language

Occasionally a feature may need to be specified whose lookups vary across the
language systems of the feature, or whose language systems vary from the set
of language systems of the rest of the features in the file, as specified by
the `languagesystem` statements. In these cases, `script` and `language`
statements will need to be used within the feature block itself.
Such statements affect only that feature. **Note**: you may not use the `script`
or `language` keywords within a standalone lookup block.

Rules that are specified after the start of a feature and before the first
`script` and/or `language` statement will be included in all the language
systems specified by the `languagesystem` statements. If you do not want any of
the rules in the feature to be registered under the language systems specified
by the `languagesystem` statements, then a `script` and/or `language` statement
for a script must be present before the first rule in the feature.

Once the first script or language statement occurs within a feature block,
subsequent lookups and rules are registered only within the currently specified
script and language. To register a rule or lookup under more than one script
and language, you must explicitly include it following each script and language
specification.

The one exception to this rule are the default lookups. There are two levels of
default lookups. Rules specified between the start of a feature definition and
the first `script` are added to all language-systems, unless a language
statement specifies the `exclude_dflt` keyword. Rules specified between the
occurrence of the `script` statement and the first language statement other than
`dflt` are added to explicitly specified languages for the current script, but
not to other scripts, nor to other languages of the same script that are not
named in the feature. If your font has several languages for a given script, and
you need language specific rules for only some of the languages, you should
still explicitly name all of the languages so that they will inherit the
script-level default rules.

The current script and language attributes may be changed as follows:

##### script statement:

```fea
script <script tag>;
```

For example:

```fea
script kana;
```

When a `script` statement is seen, the language attribute is implicitly set to
`dflt`, and the `lookupflag` attribute is implicitly set to 0. The script
attribute stays the same until explicitly changed by another `script` statement
or until the end of the feature.

##### language statement:
The language attribute stays the same until explicitly changed, until the script
is changed, or until the end of the feature. To change the language attribute,
use the `language` statement:

```fea
language <language tag> [exclude_dflt|include_dflt] [required];
```

To exclude a set of rules from only one or a few languages, you must define the
set of rules as a lookup, and explicitly include the lookup in under the
languages that should include it, and omit it from the rules included under the
languages where it should be excluded.

**Note:** the `excludeDFLT` and `includeDFLT` keywords still work, but are
deprecated and will cause a warning to appear.

Here is an example statement:

```fea
language DEU;
```

As a result of this statement, (a) the language attribute is changed to `DEU `,
and (b) the current default lookups are automatically included into the language
system specified by the current script and language DEU.

If (b) is not desired, as may occasionally be the case, then the keyword
`exclude_dflt` must follow the language tag. For example:

```fea
language DEU exclude_dflt;
```

The keyword `include_dflt` may be used to explicitly indicate the default default
lookup-inheriting behavior. For example:

```fea
language DEU include_dflt;
# Same as:    language DEU;
```

The keyword `required`, when present, specifies the current feature as the
required feature for the specified language system.

_[ The keyword `required` is currently not implemented. ]_

Since the `aalt` and `size` features are treated specially, `script` and
`language` statements are not allowed within these features.

Special notes:

*   `DFLT` is a valid value for the `script` tag, and `dflt` is not.
*   `dflt` is a valid value for the `language` tag, and `DFLT` is not.
*   There is no such thing as a `dflt` language tag in the actual OpenType data
structures; the data structures hold these rules in a special record, rather
than referencing them from the list of language tags for the current script. The
`dflt` language tag is just a convenience in the feature file syntax for setting
the current language to be the default language system.

Please see §[4.h](#4.h) below for detailed examples.

<a name="4.c"></a>
### 4.c. parameters

The `parameters` statement specifies the feature parameters for the currently
defined language system. It is currently supported only for the `size`, `ssXX`,
and `cvXX` features; see § [8.b](#8.b), [8.c](#8.c) and [8.d](#8.d).

<a name="4.d"></a>
### 4.d. lookupflag

The chapter [“Common Table Formats”](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/chapter2)
in the OpenType specification describes the LookupFlag field in the Lookup table.

The `lookupflag` attribute defaults to 0 at the start of a feature or named
lookup block.

The `lookupflag` attribute stays the same until explicitly changed, until a
lookup reference statement is encountered that changes it, until the script is
changed, or until the end of the feature.

To change the `lookupflag` attribute explicitly, use the `lookupflag` statement,
which takes two formats:

##### lookupflag format A:

```fea
lookupflag <named lookupflag value> (<named lookupflag value>)*;
```

Here, the individual lookup flag values to be set are expressed in a list of one
or more `<named lookupflag value>`s, in no particular order, separated by
spaces. A `<named lookupflag value>` is one of the following:

```fea
RightToLeft
IgnoreBaseGlyphs
IgnoreLigatures
IgnoreMarks
MarkAttachmentType <glyphclass|glyphclass name>
UseMarkFilteringSet <glyphclass|glyphclass name>
```

At most one of each of the above 6 kinds of `<named lookupflag>` values may be
present in a lookupflag statement. For example, to skip over base glyphs
and ligature glyphs:

```fea
lookupflag IgnoreBaseGlyphs IgnoreLigatures;
```

Base, ligature, and mark glyphs are specified in the glyph class definition
of the GDEF table.

To skip over all mark glyphs except for those of mark class @TOP_MARKS:

```fea
lookupflag MarkAttachmentType @TOP_MARKS;
```

The class name used with `MarkAttachmentType` can be either a regular glyph
class name or a mark class name. The glyph sets of the referenced classes must
not overlap, and the MarkAttachmentType statement can reference at most 15
different classes.

The flag `UseMarkFilteringSet` was added in OpenType spec 1.6. This works the
same as the `MarkAttachmentType`, but allows you to use up to 16K different mark
classes, and allows the glyph sets of the referenced classes to overlap.

`MarkAttachmentType` and `UseMarkFilteringSet` can also use glyph classes
directly, with the same restrictions as above.

```fea
lookupflag UseMarkFilteringSet [acute grave];
```

##### lookupflag format B:

```fea
lookupflag <number>;
```

Here the entire lookup flag value is specified simply as a `<number>`.
The format A example above could equivalently be expressed as:

```fea
lookupflag 6;
```

Format A is clearly a superior choice for human readability when the
`lookupflag` value is not 0. However, a `lookupflag` value of 0 can be set only
with format B, not with format A:

```fea
lookupflag 0;
```

The base glyphs, ligatures, and mark classes are defined in the `GlyphClassDef`
of the GDEF table block [§[9.b](#9.b)].

<a name="4.e"></a>
### 4.e. lookup

A lookup is a group of rules of the same type. The font editor can label a run
of rules and refer to it explicitly later on, in order to have different parts
of the font tables refer to the same lookup. This decreases the size of the font
in addition to freeing the editor from maintaining duplicate sets of rules.

A lookup in the OpenType font will be created from each named lookup block or
each run of rules with the same feature, script, language, lookupflag and lookup
type attribute.

To define and label a lookup, use a named lookup block:

```fea
lookup <label> [useExtension] {
    # rules to be grouped
} <label>;
```

A named lookup block may be defined either inside or outside of a feature block.
In either case, it may be referenced in different feature blocks. If it is
defined outside a feature block, is is referred to as a ‘standalone’ lookup.

The lookup will be created with a GSUB or GPOS Extension lookup type if and only
if the optional `useExtension` keyword is used.

A lookup block may be defined either inside or outside of feature blocks.
**Note**: you may not use the `script` or `language` keywords within a standalone
lookup block.

The `useExtension` keyword has two effects: all the records of all types that
are referenced by a lookup qualifier are placed in one contiguous block of data,
and the offset to the lookup may be 32 bits rather than limited to 16 bits.

When your font cannot be built because of an offset overflow error (meaning that
the offset from one record to another record exceeds the 64 Kbyte limit imposed
by the maximum size possible for a 16-bit offset field), then add this qualifier
to the largest lookup. Keep adding it to more lookups until your font will
build.

(Note: Extension lookup types were added in OpenType specification v1.3).

(See also §[8.a](#8.a) for how to specify the entire `aalt` feature be made with
the Extension lookup type.)

To refer to the lookup later on, use a lookup reference statement:

```fea
lookup <label>;
```

For example:

```fea
lookup SHARED {      # lookup definition
    # ...
} SHARED;

# ...
lookup SHARED;       # lookup reference
```

An example of a lookup that uses the Extension lookup type:

```fea
lookup EXTENDED_KERNING useExtension {       # lookup definition
    # ...
} EXTENDED_KERNING;

# ...
lookup EXTENDED_KERNING;    # lookup reference. useExtension not needed
```

Since the labeled block literally defines a single lookup in the font, the rules
within the lookup block must be of the same lookup type and have the same
`lookupflag` attribute. A lookup block may not contain any other kind of block.
The order of lookups within a font is defined by the order of the lookup
definitions in the feature file.

For contextual rules, the rules of the lookup are ordered in the font file in
the same order that they are written in the feature file. For non-contextual
rules, the implementation sorts the rules to avoid conflict; for example, the
ligature substitution rule for f_f_i will be written before the ligature
substitution rule for f_i, no matter what their order is in the feature file.

<a name="4.f"></a>
### 4.f. markClass

The `markClass` keyword is used to identify a mark glyph class definition
statement.

A mark glyph class name is defined differently than a regular glyph class. The
mark class definition is built up by a one or more of statements in the form:

```fea
markClass <glyph|glyphclass> <anchor> <mark glyph class name>;
```

Each additional mark statement for a mark class adds the referenced glyphs to
that mark class.

The `<anchor>` [§[2.e.vii](#2.e.vii)] indicates the point on the mark glyph(s)
by which it is attached to a matching anchor point on a base glyph.
If a mark glyph has an anchor point at `<anchor 300, 0>` and the base glyph
has an anchor point at `<anchor 400 300>`, then the mark glyph will be shifted
so that the point x = 300, y = 0 in its design space will be superimposed on
the point x = 300, y = 400 in the design space of the base glyph.

For example:

```fea
markClass [acute grave dieresis] <anchor 350 0> @MARK_TOP_ACCENTS;
```

If all the mark glyphs which belong to a mark class have the same anchor, then
the mark class can be defined with a single statement, as above.
However, a single mark statement can define only a single anchor point, so
when glyphs in a mark class have different anchor points, more than one mark
statement must be used to define the mark class. For example:

```fea
markClass [acute grave] <anchor 350 0> @MARK_TOP_ACCENTS;
markClass [dieresis umlaut] <anchor 400 0> @MARK_TOP_ACCENTS;
```

**Note:** All mark class definition statements must precede any use of a mark
class in the feature file. Once any position statement has referenced a mark
class, no more mark statements are allowed.

**Note:** The mark classes used within a single lookup must be disjoint: none
may include a glyph which is in another mark class that is used within the same
lookup.

**Note:** If a GDEF table is not explicitly defined in the feature file, then an
implementation of this syntax will create one. In this case, it will use the set
of defined mark classes to define the mark glyphs for the GDEF GlyphClass. In
this case, the assignment of a glyph to the GDEF GlyphClass mark class may
conflict with other assignments to the other GDEF GlyphClass classes. In this
case, an implementation should warn the user of the conflict.

The set of mark classes has an implicit order. An implementation should order
the mark classes in the order of occurrence of the first definition statement
for a mark glyph class. In the example:

```fea
markClass [acute grave] <anchor 350 0> @MARK_TOP_ACCENTS;
markClass [cedilla hook] <anchor 300 0> @MARK_BOTTOM_ACCENTS;
markClass [dieresis umlaut] <anchor 400 0> @MARK_TOP_ACCENTS;
```

the mark class order will be:

```fea
@MARK_TOP_ACCENTS # mark class index 0
@MARK_BOTTOM_ACCENTS # mark class index 1
```

<a name="4.g"></a>
### 4.g. subtable

The feature file implementation must insert subtable breaks among the rules for
a particular lookup if needed. For example, if a set of alternate substitution
rules specified in the feature file exceeds the subtable size limit, several
subtables must be automatically created.

The `subtable` statement may be used as follows:

```fea
subtable;
```

to explicitly force a subtable break after the previous rule.

This statement must be respected in Pair Adjustment Positioning Format 2 (i.e.
pair class kerning) but in other cases may be ignored and the implementation
software may insert its own subtable breaks. See [_6.b.iii_](#6.b.iii) for
details. This hint to the compiler is required for class kerning, as it is
difficult for a compiler to determine where to best place a subtable break in
this lookup type, in order to reduce lookup size.

<a name="4.h"></a>
### 4.h. Examples

###### Example 1:
The following is an example of an entire feature file and demonstrates the two
ways to register features under language systems (see §[4.b](#4.b) above):

```fea
languagesystem DFLT dflt;
languagesystem latn dflt;
languagesystem latn DEU;
languagesystem latn TRK;
languagesystem cyrl dflt;

feature smcp {
    sub [a-z] by [A.sc-Z.sc];
    # Since all the rules in this feature are of the same type, they will be grouped in a single lookup.
    # Since no script or language keyword has been specified yet,
    # the lookup will be registered for this feature under all the language systems.
} smcp;

feature liga {
    sub f f by f_f;
    sub f i by f_i;
    sub f l by f_l;
    # Since all the rules in this feature are of the same type, they will be
    # grouped in a single lookup.
    # Since no script or language keyword has been specified yet,
    # the lookup will be registered for this feature under all the language systems.

    script latn;
        language dflt;
        # lookupflag 0;      (implicit)
            sub c t by c_t;
            sub c s by c_s;
        # The rules above will be placed in a lookup that is registered for all
        # the specified languages for the script latn, but not any other scripts.

        language DEU;
        # script latn;       (stays the same)
        # lookupflag 0;      (stays the same)
            sub c h by c_h;
            sub c k by c_k;
        # The rules above will be placed in a lookup that is registered only
        # under the script 'latn', 'language DEU'.

        language TRK;
        # This will inherit both the top level default rules - the rules defined
        # before the first 'script' statement, and the script-level default
        # rules for 'latn: all the lookups of this feature defined after the
        # 'script latn' statement, and before the 'language DEU' statement.
        # If 'TRK' were not named here, it would not inherit the default rules
        # for the script 'latn'.
} liga;

feature kern {
    pos a y -150;
    # [more pos statements]
    # All the rules in this feature will be grouped in a single lookup
    # that is registered under all the languagesystems.
} kern;
```

In the above example feature file, the `smcp` and `kern` features will be
registered under the `DFLT`/`dflt`, `latn`/`dflt`, `latn`/`DEU `, `latn`/`TRK`
and `cyrl`/`dflt` language systems since no explicit `script` or `language`
statements are present in those features.

In the `liga` feature, the f_f, f_i and f_l ligature substitutions will be
applied under all language systems. The c_t and c_s ligature substitutions
will be applied under all languages of the script latn, but not under any other
scripts. The c_h and c_k ligature substitutions will be applied when the
language is German (i.e. they are registered only under `latn`/`DEU `).

###### Example 2:
The following example illustrates labeled lookup blocks and the use of the
`exclude_dflt` keyword:

```fea
languagesystem DFLT dflt;
languagesystem latn dflt;
languagesystem latn DEU;
languagesystem cyrl dflt;
languagesystem cyrl SRB;
languagesystem grek dflt;

feature liga {
    # start of default rules that are applied under all language systems.
    lookup HAS_I {
        sub f f i by f_f_i;
        sub f i by f_i;
    } HAS_I;

    lookup NO_I {
        sub f f l by f_f_l;
        sub f f by f_f;
    } NO_I;

    # end of default rules that are applied under all language systems.

    script latn;
        language dflt;
        # default lookup for latn included under all languages for the latn script
        sub f l by f_l;

        language DEU;
        # default lookups included under the DEU language.
        sub c h by c_h;
        sub c k by c_k;

        language TRK exclude_dflt;   # default lookups are excluded.
            lookup NO_I;             # Only this lookup is included under the TRK language

    script cyrl;
        language SRB;
            sub c t by c_t; # this rule will apply only under script cyrl language SRB.
} liga;
```

*   The `DFLT`/`dflt`, `cyrl`/`dflt`, and `grek`/`dflt` language systems will
    all contain the default rules for `liga` functionality, the rules in the
    lookups HAS_I and NO_I.

*   Under the `latn` script, all languages but TRK will contain the default
    lookups, and the f_l ligature rule.

*   The c_h and c_k ligatures will apply only for the `latn`/`DEU ` language
    system.

*   The `latn`/`TRK ` language system will contain only the NO_I lookup.

*   The `cyrl`/`SRB ` language system will contain all the default rules, and the
    c_t ligature rule.

Note that if you specify no explicit rules or lookup references after a script
and language statement, then the effect is to include all the default rules for
all scripts for the feature. Note also that lookup HAS_I must be placed before
lookup NO_I since the f_f_i substitution must precede the f_f substitution when
both are applied. (See [7: Ordering of lookups and rules in the feature file](#7)).

The ordering of ligature rules within a particular lookup does not matter,
excepting contextual rules, as the implementation will sort non-contextual rules
in order to avoid conflict. For example, in lookup HAS_I, the f_i substitution
may be placed before the f_f_i substitution, because the implementation will
sort the f_f_i substitution first when writing the lookup to the font.
(See [5.d: Ligature substitution](#5.d)).

## 5. Glyph substitution (GSUB) rules

Glyph substitution rules begin with the keyword `substitute`; this keyword may
be abbreviated as `sub`. (The `ignore` keyword may precede the `substitute`
keyword in some cases.) The GSUB lookup type is auto-detected from the format
of the rest of the rule.

<a name="5.a"></a>
### 5.a. [GSUB LookupType 1] Single substitution

A Single Sub rule is specified in one of the following formats:

```fea
substitute <glyph> by <glyph>;            # format A
substitute <glyphclass> by <glyph>;       # format B
substitute <glyphclass> by <glyphclass>;  # format C
```

Format B specifies that any glyph in the target glyph class must be replaced by
the same replacement glyph.

Format C specifies that any of the glyphs in the target glyph class must be
replaced by its corresponding glyph (in the order of glyphs in the glyph
classes) in the replacement glyph class. If the replacement is a singleton glyph
class, then the rule will be treated identically to a format B rule. If the
replacement class has more than one glyph, then the number of elements in the
target and replacement glyph classes must be the same.

For example:

```fea
sub a by A.sc;                                                 # format A
substitute [one.fitted one.oldstyle one.tab.oldstyle] by one;  # format B
substitute [a - z] by [A.sc - Z.sc];                           # format C
substitute @Capitals by @CapSwashes;                           # format C
```

The third line in the above example produces an identical representation in the
font as:

```fea
substitute a by A.sc;
substitute b by B.sc;
substitute c by C.sc;
# ...
substitute z by Z.sc;
```

If the replacement glyph is the reserved word `NULL`, then the substitution
has no replacement, removing the input glyph from the glyph sequence:

```fea
substitute a by NULL;
```

Omitting the `by` clause is equivalent to adding `by NULL`. 

<a name="5.b"></a>
### 5.b. [GSUB LookupType 2] Multiple substitution

A Multiple Sub rule is specified as:

```fea
substitute <glyph> by <glyph sequence>;
```

`<glyph sequence>` contains two or more glyphs. It may not contain glyph
classes. (If it did, the rule would be ambiguous as to which replacement
sequence were required.) For example:

```fea
substitute f_f_i by f f i;            # Ligature decomposition
```

<a name="5.c"></a>
### 5.c. [GSUB LookupType 3] Alternate substitution

An Alternate Sub rule is specified as:

```fea
substitute <glyph> from <glyphclass>;
```

For example:

```fea
substitute ampersand from [ampersand.1 ampersand.2 ampersand.3];
```

<a name="5.d"></a>
### 5.d. [GSUB LookupType 4] Ligature substitution

A Ligature Sub rule is specified as:

```fea
substitute <glyph sequence> by <glyph>;
```

`<glyph sequence>` must contain two or more of `<glyph|glyphclass>`. For
example:

```fea
substitute [one one.oldstyle] [slash fraction] [two two.oldstyle] by onehalf;
```

Since the OpenType specification does not allow ligature substitutions to be
specified on target sequences that contain glyph classes, the implementation
software will enumerate all specific glyph sequences if glyph classes are
detected in `<glyph sequence>`. Thus, the above example produces an identical
representation in the font as if all the sequences were manually enumerated by
the font editor:

```fea
substitute  one           slash     two           by  onehalf;
substitute  one.oldstyle  slash     two           by  onehalf;
substitute  one           fraction  two           by  onehalf;
substitute  one.oldstyle  fraction  two           by  onehalf;
substitute  one           slash     two.oldstyle  by  onehalf;
substitute  one.oldstyle  slash     two.oldstyle  by  onehalf;
substitute  one           fraction  two.oldstyle  by  onehalf;
substitute  one.oldstyle  fraction  two.oldstyle  by  onehalf;
```

A contiguous set of ligature rules does not need to be ordered in any particular
way by the font editor; the implementation software must do the appropriate
sorting. So:

```fea
sub f f     by f_f;
sub f i     by f_i;
sub f f i   by f_f_i;
sub o f f i by o_f_f_i;
```

will produce an identical representation in the font as:

```fea
sub o f f i by o_f_f_i;
sub f f i   by f_f_i;
sub f f     by f_f;
sub f i     by f_i;
```

### 5.e. [GSUB LookupType 5] Contextual substitution

This LookupType is a functional subset of GSUB LookupType 6, chaining contextual
substitution. Thus, all desired rules of this LookupType can be expressed in
terms of chaining contextual substitution rules.

<a name="5.f"></a>
### 5.f. [GSUB LookupType 6] Chaining contextual substitution

<a name="5.f.i"></a>
#### 5.f.i. Specifying a Chain Sub rule and marking sub-runs

A Chain Substitution rule target sequence has three parts: backtrack, input,
and lookahead glyph sequences. A glyph sequence comprises one or more glyphs
or glyph classes.

The most important is input glyph sequence. This is the sequence of glyphs and
glyph classes to which substitution operations are applied. Optionally, a prefix
(also known as backtrack) glyph sequence may be specified, as well as a suffix
(also known as lookahead) glyph sequence. The entire sequence of glyphs — prefix
plus input plus suffix — must match in the current context for the rule to be
applied. The match sequence is aligned to the current context by aligning the
first glyph of the input sequence with the current glyph of the text being
processed. If the rule is matched, then the current context moves the current
glyph pointer ahead in the original text by the length of the input sequence.
Note that in the FEA syntax, the entire context string (backtrack sequence +
input sequence + look-ahead sequence) are all written in the text string order.
This is worth emphasis, as inside the lookup rule, the glyphs of the backtrack
sequence are written in reverse order from the text to be matched. Developers of
font editing tools who know this are sometimes confused by the FEA syntax.

For each glyph or glyph class in the input sequence, the contextual rule may
specify one or more lookups (§[4.e](#4.e)) to be applied at that position.
Note that the specified lookups may contain many rules; the implementation
must ensure that only one rule in a referenced lookup will match at that
position in the input sequence. Lookups cannot be specified for the glyphs
or glyph classes in the backtrack and lookahead sequences.

The input sequence is defined by appending the mark (`'`) character to all the
glyph names and class names within the input sequence.

The most general form of the contextual substitution rule is to explicitly
reference named lookups in the rule.

###### Example 1:
Define two standalone lookups (§[4.e](#4.e)), and then reference them in the
input sequence of contextual substitution rules with the keyword `lookup` and
the lookup name.

```fea
lookup CNTXT_LIGS {
    substitute f i by f_i;
    substitute c t by c_t;
} CNTXT_LIGS;

lookup CNTXT_SUB {
    substitute n by n.end;
    substitute s by s.end;
} CNTXT_SUB;

feature test {
    substitute [ a e i o u] f' lookup CNTXT_LIGS i' n' lookup CNTXT_SUB;
    substitute [ a e i o u] c' lookup CNTXT_LIGS t' s' lookup CNTXT_SUB;
} test;
```

Note that both the contextual substitution rules use the same lookups. This is
because there is more than one rule in each referenced lookup, and different
rules within the referenced lookups will match in the different contexts. In the
first contextual substitution rule, the lookup `CNTXT_LIGS` will be applied at
the input sequence glyph “f”, and the glyphs “f” and “i” will be replaced by
“f_i”. The lookup `CNTXT_SUB` will be applied at the input sequence glyph “n”,
and the glyph “n” will be replaced by “n.end”. This will happen only when the
sequence “f i n” is preceded by any one of the glyphs “a e i o u”. Likewise, in
the second contextual substitution rule the glyphs “c” and “t” will be replaced
by “c_t”, and the glyph “s” will be replaced by “s.end”. This will happen only
when the sequence “c t s” is preceded by any one of the glyphs “a e i o u”.

This form of the contextual substitution rule is the most flexible. You can
specify a substitution lookup for more than one input sequence glyph or glyph
class, the referenced lookups can be of different types, and the referenced
lookups can have different lookup flags that the parent contextual lookup. The
drawback is that it is difficult to understand what substitution rule will be
applied, and the implementation may not warn if the referenced lookup does not
contain a rule that matches the context.

If there is only a single substitution operation, and it is either single
substitution or ligature substitution, then the operation can be specified
in-line and its type will be auto-detected from the input and replacement
sequence in the same way as in their corresponding standalone (i.e.
non-contextual) statements.

###### Example 2:
This calls a Single Sub rule. The rule below means: in sequences “a d” or “e d”
or “n d”, substitute “d” by “d.alt”.

```fea
substitute [a e n] d' by d.alt;
```

This format requires that there be only one glyph or glyph class in the input
sequence.

###### Example 3:
This also calls a Single Sub rule. The rule below means: if a capital letter is
followed by a small capital, then replace the small capital by its corresponding
lowercase letter.

```fea
substitute [A-Z] [A.sc-Z.sc]' by [a-z];
```

This format requires that there be only one glyph or glyph class in the input
sequence.

###### Example 4:
This calls a Ligature Sub lookup. The rule below means: in sequences “e t c” or
“e.begin t c”, substitute the first two glyphs by the ampersand.

```fea
substitute [e e.begin]' t' c by ampersand;
```

This format will assume that the entire input sequence is a sequence of ligature
components.

###### Example 5:
In this example two Multiple Sub lookups are applied to the same input. The rule below means: 
in lookup `REORDER_CHAIN` the sequence “ka ka.pas_cakra.ns” is first substituted 
by “ka” and then a second lookup substitutes the remaining “ka” by the sequence “ka.pas_cakra ka”. 

```fea
lookup REMOVE_CAKRA {
    sub ka ka.pas_cakra.ns by ka;
} REMOVE_CAKRA;

lookup REORDER_CAKRA {
    sub ka by ka.pas_cakra ka;
} REORDER_CAKRA;

lookup REORDER_CHAIN {
    sub ka' lookup REMOVE_CAKRA lookup REORDER_CAKRA ka.pas_cakra.ns' ;
} REORDER_CHAIN;
```

<a name="5.f.ii"></a>
#### 5.f.ii. Specifying exceptions to the Chain Sub rule

Exceptions to a chaining contextual substitution rule are expressed by inserting
a statement of the following form anywhere before the chaining contextual rule
and in the same lookup as it:

```fea
ignore substitute <backtrack glyph sequence>*
<marked glyph sequence>
<lookahead glyph sequence>*;
```

The backtrack and lookahead sequences may be omitted, but there must be at least
one marked glyph or glyph class.

For convenience, several ignore statements may be collapsed into one by
separating the matching sequences with a comma. See Example 3. The following
three statements:

```fea
ignore substitute <match sequence1>;
ignore substitute <match sequence2>;
ignore substitute <match sequence3>;
```

can be written as:

```fea
ignore substitute <match sequence1>, <match sequence2>, <match sequence3>;
```

Note that each match sequence is in effect a complete ignore statement, and
contains its own independent backtrack, marked glyph, and lookahead sequences.

The `ignore substitute` statement works by creating subtables in the GSUB that
tell the OT layout engine simply to match the specified sequences, and not to
perform any substitutions on them. As a result of the match, remaining rules
(i.e. subtables) in the lookup will be skipped when the rule matches.
(See [OT layout algorithm](#7.a).)

###### Example 1:
Ignoring specific sequences:
The `ignore substitute` rules below will block any subsequent rules that specify
a substitution for “d” when the context around “d” matches any of the sequences
“f a d”, “f e d”, or “a d d”.

Note that the marked glyphs in the exception sequences indicate where a
substitution would have occurred; this is necessary for the OpenType layout
engine to correctly handle skipping this sequence.

```fea
ignore substitute f [a e] d';
ignore substitute a d' d;
substitute [a e n] d' by d.alt;
```

Matching a beginning-of-word boundary:
###### Example 2:

```fea
ignore substitute @LETTER f' i';
substitute f' i' by f_i.begin;
```

The example above shows how a ligature may be substituted at a word boundary.
@LETTER must be defined to include all glyphs considered to be part of a word.
The substitute statement will get applied only if the sequence doesn't match
"@LETTER f i"; i.e. only at the beginning of a word.

###### Example 3:
Matching a whole word boundary:

```fea
ignore substitute @LETTER a' n' d', a' n' d' @LETTER;
substitute a' n' d' by a_n_d;
```

In this example, the a_n_d ligature will apply only if the sequence “a n d” is
neither preceded nor succeeded by a @LETTER. Also, note the use of the comma in
the `ignore` statement: this is equivalent to writing:

```fea
ignore substitute @LETTER a' n' d';
ignore substitute a' n' d' @LETTER;
substitute a' n' d' by a_n_d;
```

###### Example 4:
This shows a specification for the contextual swashes feature:

```fea
feature cswh {

    # --- Glyph classes used in this feature:
    @BEGINNINGS = [A-N P-Z Th m];
    @BEGINNINGS_SWASH = [A.swash-N.swash P.swash-Z.swash T_h.swash m.begin];
    @ENDINGS = [a e z];
    @ENDINGS_SWASH = [a.end e.end z.end];

    # --- Beginning-of-word swashes:
    ignore substitute @LETTER @BEGINNINGS';
    substitute @BEGINNINGS' by @BEGINNINGS_SWASH;

    # --- End-of-word swashes:
    ignore substitute @ENDINGS' @LETTER;
    substitute @ENDINGS' by @ENDINGS_SWASH;

} cswh;
```

If a feature only targets glyphs at the beginning or ending of a word, such as
the `init` and `fina` features, then the application could be made responsible
for detecting the word boundary; the feature itself would be simply defined as
the appropriate substitutions without regard for word boundary. Such application
responsibilities must be described in the feature tag registry.

### 5.g. [GSUB LookupType 7] Extension substitution

The `useExtension` keyword specifies creating lookups of this lookup type. See
§[4.e](#4.e) and §[8.a](#8.a).

<a name="5.h"></a>
### 5.h. [GSUB LookupType 8] Reverse Chaining Single Substitution

A Reverse Chaining Single Substitution shares the same syntax as a Chaining
Contextual Substitution rule. The syntactic differences are that it can specify
only single substitutions, the marked target sequence can consist of only a
single glyph or glyph class, and the rule is specified with the keyword
reversesub or rsub. An application’s layout engine will also treat this rule
differently than any other rule type; the lookup is applied to the text string
in the reverse of the logical reading order.

The rule is specified as follows:

```fea
reversesub [a e n] d' by d.alt;
```

As with `substitute`, if the replacement glyph is the reserved word `NULL`
then the reverse substitution has no replacement, removing the glyph from the
sequence.  Omitting the `by` clause is equivalent to adding `by NULL`. 

<a name="6"></a>
## 6. Glyph positioning (GPOS) rules

Glyph positioning rules begin with the keyword `position`; this keyword may be
abbreviated as `pos`. (The `enumerate` or `ignore` keywords may precede the
`position` keyword in some cases.) The GPOS lookup type is auto-detected from
the format of the rest of the rule.

Glyph positioning is specified in terms of metrics [§[2.e.ii](#2.e.ii)], device
tables [§[2.e.iii](#2.e.iii)], value records [§[2.e.iv](#2.e.iv)], and anchors
[§[2.e.vii](#2.e.vii)]. In all positioning rules, these are inserted immediately
after the glyph(s) they apply to, with the exception of Pair Pos format B.

<a name="6.a"></a>
### 6.a. [GPOS LookupType 1] Single adjustment positioning

A Single Pos rule is specified as:

```fea
position <glyph|glyphclass> <valuerecord>;
```

Here, the `<glyph|glyphclass>` is adjusted by the
`<valuerecord>`[§[2.e.iv](#2.e.iv)]. For example, to reduce the left and right
side-bearings of a glyph each by 80 design units:

```fea
position one <-80 0 -160 0>;
```

<a name="6.b"></a>
### 6.b. [GPOS LookupType 2] Pair adjustment positioning

<a name="6.b.i"></a>
#### 6.b.i. Specific and class pair kerning

Rules for this LookupType are usually used for kerning, and may be in either of
2 formats:

##### Pair Pos format A:

```fea
position <glyph|glyphclass> <valuerecord>
         <glyph|glyphclass> <valuerecord>;
```

The first `<valuerecord>`[§[2.e.iv](#2.e.iv)] corresponds to the first
`<glyph|glyphclass>`, and the second `<valuerecord>` corresponds to the second
`<glyph|glyphclass>`. The following example illustrates an unusual way to
specify a kern value of -100:

```fea
position T -60 a <-40 0 -40 0>;
```

##### Pair Pos format B:

```fea
position <glyph|glyphclass> <glyph|glyphclass>
         <valuerecord>;     # for first <glyph|glyphclass>
```

This format is provided since it closely parallels the way kerning is expressed
in AFM files. Thus, it is a shorter way of expressing:

```fea
position <glyph|glyphclass> <valuerecord format A> <glyph|glyphclass> <NULL>;
```

Kerning can most easily be expressed with this format. This will result in
adjusting the first glyph’s x advance, except when in the `vrkn` feature, in
which case it will adjust the first glyph’s y advance. Some examples:

```fea
pos T a -100;        # specific pair (no glyph class present)
pos [T] a -100;      # class pair (singleton glyph class present)
pos T @a -100;       # class pair (glyph class present, even if singleton)
pos @T [a o u] -80;  # class pair
```

Note that in both formats A and B, if at least one glyph class is present (even
if it is a singleton glyph class), then the rule is interpreted as a class pair;
otherwise, the rule is interpreted as a specific pair.

In the `kern` feature, the specific glyph pairs should precede the glyph class
pairs in the feature file, mirroring the way that they will be stored in the
font. Otherwise, depending on the implementation, the specific glyph pairs
following any class pair may never be applied. (See §[7](#7), “Ordering of
lookups and rules in the feature file,” below.)

```fea
feature kern {
    # specific pairs for all scripts
    # class pairs for all scripts
} kern;
```

<a name="6.b.ii"></a>
#### 6.b.ii. Enumerating pairs

If some specific pairs are more conveniently represented as a class pair, but
the editor does not want the pairs to be in a class kerning subtable, then the
class pair must be preceded by the keyword `enumerate` (which can be abbreviated
as `enum`). The implementation software will enumerate such pairs as specific
pairs. Thus, these pairs can be thought of as “class exceptions” to class pairs.
For example:

```fea
@Y_LC = [y yacute ydieresis];
@SMALL_PUNC = [comma semicolon period];

enum pos @Y_LC semicolon -80;     # specific pairs
pos      f quoteright 30;         # specific pair
pos      @Y_LC @SMALL_PUNC -100;  # class pair
```

The `enum` rule above can be replaced by:

```fea
pos y semicolon -80;
pos yacute semicolon -80;
pos ydieresis semicolon -80;
```

without changing the representation in the font. Since this representation is
convenient for generating a large number of specific pairs, it may be used even
when some of the pairs generated by the `enum` rules are incorrect. Specific
pairs generated by an `enum` rule may be overridden by specifying preceding
single pairs. Because of this case, it is not an error when specific kern pairs
conflict because they have the same glyphs. When specific kern pair rules
conflict, the first rule specified is used, and later conflicting rule are
skipped.

<a name="6.b.iii"></a>
#### 6.b.iii. Subtable breaks

The implementation software will insert a subtable break within a run of class
pair rules if a single subtable cannot be created due to class overlap. A
warning will be emitted. For example:

```fea
pos [Ygrave] [colon semicolon] -55;   # [line 99]   In first subtable
pos [Y Yacute] period -50;            # [line 100]  In first subtable
pos [Y Yacute Ygrave] period -60;     # [line 101]  In second subtable
```

will produce a warning that a new subtable has been started at line 101, and
that some kern pairs within this subtable may never be accessed. Note that this
allows the font to be built, but the result will not match the developer’s
intention. The kerning feature will not work as expected until the causes for
all such errors are removed. The pair “Ygrave period” will have a value of 0 if
the above example comprised the entire lookup, since “Ygrave” is in the coverage
(i.e. union of the first glyphs) of the first subtable. One way to understand
this is to imagine a lookup table of kern class pairs as a spreadsheet of all
possible pairs of kern left-side classes that are used in the lookup table with
all the kern right-side classes that are used in the lookup table. Imagine each
left side class is the title of a row in the spreadsheet, and each right side
class is the title of a column. A glyph can be put in only one row title, and in
only one column title. All glyphs not named in a row title get put together in a
special row title. All glyphs not named in a column title get put together in a
special column title. When you specify the value of a class pair, you are
specifying the value in only one cell of the spreadsheet. When you specify a
series of kern pair rules between a particular left side class and a series of
right side classes, you are filling in a series of cells in the row for the
specific left side class. All cells for which no values are specified are set to
0. When programs look for a kern value between “Ygrave” and something else, they
look through the list of left side class definitions to find the first
occurrence of “Ygrave”. By definition, the first spreadsheet row which includes
“Ygrave” will define the kern pair value of “Ygrave” with all other right-side
classes, e.g spreadsheet columns. Since a pair value with a right-side period
has not been explicitly defined at this point, the default value is 0. Since the
programs will not look further than this row, the kern class pair:

```fea
pos [Y Yacute Ygrave] period -60;
```

will never be used.

Sometimes the class kerning subtable may get too large. The editor can make it
smaller by forcing subtable breaks at any point by inserting the statement:

```fea
subtable;
```

between two class kerning rules. The new subtable created will still be in the
same lookup, so the editor must ensure that the coverages of the subtables thus
created do not overlap, since the processing rules will not find and report a
conflict.

When seeking to decrease the class table size, it is best to place subtable
breaks between blocks of rules where there is no cross linking, such that no
left side class in one block is used with any right side class in the other
block. However, in most large Western fonts, such groups are so small that
breaking them into separate subtables does not yield much decrease in the
overall lookup size. In this common case, an adequate strategy is to first
divide the entire list of kern class rules in two roughly equal blocks with a
subtable break. If this does not make the class kern tables small enough, then
continue to subdivide each block of rules in two with a subtable break. Because
the class definitions must be repeated for each subtable, a point of diminishing
returns usually comes with around 6 subtable breaks.

<a name="6.c"></a>
### 6.c. [GPOS LookupType 3] Cursive attachment positioning

A Cursive Pos rule is specified as:

```fea
position cursive
    <glyph|glyphclass>
    <anchor>   # Entry anchor
    <anchor>;  # Exit anchor
```

The first `<anchor>` [§[2.e.vii](#2.e.vii)] indicates the entry anchor point for
`<glyph|glyphclass>`; the second, the exit anchor point.

For example, to define the entry point of glyph meem.medial to be at x=500,
y=20, and the exit point to be at x=0, y=-20:

```fea
position cursive meem.medial <anchor 500 20> <anchor 0 -20>;
```

A glyph may have a defined entry point, exit point, or both. `<anchor>` format
D, the null anchor, must be used to indicate that an `<anchor>` is not defined.

```fea
position cursive meem.end <anchor 500 20> <anchor NULL>;
```

<a name="6.d"></a>
### 6.d. [GPOS LookupType 4] Mark-to-Base attachment positioning

A Mark-to-Base Pos rule is specified as:

```fea
position base <glyph|glyphclass> # base glyph(s)
    # Anchor and mark glyph class, repeated for each
    # attachment point on the base glyph(s)
    <anchor> mark <named mark glyphclass> +
    ;
```

Each `<anchor>` [§[2.e.vii](#2.e.vii)] indicates the anchor point on the base
glyph(s) to which the mark class’ anchor point should be attached.

A single Mark-To-Base statement must specify all the anchor points and their
attaching mark classes.

This rule type does not actually support base glyph classes; the feature file
syntax allows this in order to compactly specify Mark-To-Base rules for the set
of glyphs which have the same anchor points. A feature file rule which uses a
glyph class for the base glyph is expanded in the font to a separate rule for
each glyph in the base class, although they will share the same anchor and mark
class records.

The named mark glyph classes and the anchor points of all the mark glyphs in the
named mark classes must have been previously defined in the feature file by
markClass statements [§[4.f](#4.f)].

**Note:** The mark classes used within a single lookup must be disjoint: none
may include a glyph which is in another mark class that is used within the same
lookup.

For example, to specify that the anchor of mark glyphs acute and grave is at
x=30, y=600, and that the anchor of mark glyphs dieresis and umlaut is at x=60,
y=600, and to position the anchor point of the four mark glyphs at anchor point
x=250, y=450 of glyphs a, e, o and u:

```fea
markClass [acute grave] <anchor 150 -10> @TOP_MARKS;
markClass [dieresis umlaut] <anchor 300 -10> @TOP_MARKS;
markClass [cedilla] <anchor 300 600> @BOTTOM_MARKS;

position base [a e o u] <anchor 250 450> mark @TOP_MARKS
                        <anchor 250 -10> mark @BOTTOM_MARKS;
```

<a name="6.e"></a>
### 6.e. [GPOS LookupType 5] Mark-to-Ligature attachment positioning

A Mark-to-Ligature Pos rule is specified as:

```fea
position ligature <ligature glyph|glyphclass>   # ligature glyph or glyph class
    # Anchor and named mark glyph class, repeated for
    # each anchor point on the first component glyph:
    <anchor> mark <named mark glyph class> +

    # Start of anchor and mark info for the next ligature component
    ligComponent

    # Anchor and named mark glyph class, repeated for
    # each anchor point on the next component glyph:
    <anchor> mark <named mark glyph class> +

    # Additional blocks of ligComponent plus anchor and named mark glyph class
    ;
```

The statement must specify all the anchor-mark class pairs for all the ligature
components. It follows the form of the Mark-To-Base rule, except that a set of
anchor-mark class pairs must be specified for each component glyph in the
ligature. The set of anchor-mark class pairs for one component is separated for
the set of the next component by the `ligComponent` keyword. If there are no
anchor points on a component, it must still specify at least one anchor, which
should be the NULL anchor. It is not required that each component have the same
number of anchor points.

The named mark glyph classes and the anchor points of all the mark glyphs in the
named mark classes must have been previously defined in the feature file by
markClass statements [§[4.f](#4.f)].

The example in the OpenType specification for this LookupType could be expressed
as:

```fea
# 1. Define mark anchors:
markClass sukun    <anchor 261 488> @TOP_MARKS;
markClass kasratan <anchor 346 -98> @BOTTOM_MARKS;

# 2. Define mark-to-ligature rules:
position ligature lam_meem_jeem
    <anchor 625 1800> mark @TOP_MARKS     # mark above lam
    ligComponent                          # start specifying marks for meem
    <anchor 376 -368> mark @BOTTOM_MARKS  # mark below meem
    ligComponent                          # start specifying marks for jeem
    <anchor NULL>;                        # jeem has no marks
```

Note that a NULL anchor needs to be specified for a ligature component only when
it has no non-NULL anchors. Otherwise, the implementation will supply a NULL
anchor for each mark class that is not used by a ligature component.

If a glyph class is used, each ligature in the glyph class must have the same
number of components and the same anchor positions on each component.

<a name="6.f"></a>
### 6.f. [GPOS LookupType 6] Mark-to-Mark attachment positioning

A Mark-to-Mark Pos rule is specified as:

```fea
position mark <glyph|glyphclass> # mark glyph(s)
    # Anchor and mark glyph class, repeated for each
    # attachment point on the mark glyph(s)
    <anchor> mark <named mark glyphclass> +
    ;
```

This rule is distinguished from a Mark-to-Base Pos rule [§[6.d](#6.d)] by the
first `mark` keyword. Otherwise, it has the same syntax and restrictions.

The example in the OpenType specification for this LookupType could be expressed
as:

```fea
# 1. Define name mark class:
markClass damma <anchor 189 -103> @MARK_CLASS_1;
# 2. Define mark-to-mark rule:
position mark hamza <anchor 221 301> mark @MARK_CLASS_1;
```

### 6.g. [GPOS LookupType 7] Contextual positioning

This LookupType is a functional subset of GPOS LookupType 8, chaining contextual
positioning. Thus, all desired rules of this LookupType can be expressed in
terms of chaining contextual positioning rules.

<a name="6.h"></a>
### 6.h. [GPOS LookupType 8] Chaining contextual positioning

<a name="6.h.i"></a>
#### 6.h.i. Specifying a Chain Positioning rule and marking sub-run

A Chain Positioning rule target sequence has three parts: backtrack, input, and
lookahead glyph sequences. A glyph sequence comprises one or more glyphs or
glyph classes.

The most important is input glyph sequence. This is the sequence of glyphs and
glyph classes to which positioning operations are applied. Optionally, a prefix
(also known as backtrack) glyph sequence may be specified, as well as a suffix
(also known as lookahead) glyph sequence. The entire sequence of glyphs — prefix
plus input plus suffix — must match in the current context for the rule to be
applied. The match sequence is aligned to the current context by aligning the
first glyph of the input sequence with the current glyph of the text being
processed. If the rule is matched, then the current context moves the current
glyph pointer ahead in the original text by the length of the input sequence.
Note that in the FEA syntax, the entire context string (backtrack sequence +
input sequence + look-ahead sequence) are all written in the text string order.
This is worth emphasis, as inside the lookup rule, the glyphs of the backtrack
sequence are written in reverse order from the text to be matched. Developers of
font editing tools who know this are sometimes confused by the FEA syntax.

For each glyph or glyph class in the input sequence, the contextual rule may
specify one or more lookups (§[4.e](#4.e)) to be applied at that position. Note
that the specified lookups may contain many rules; the implementation must
ensure that only one rule in a referenced lookup will match at that position
in the input sequence. Lookups cannot be specified for the glyphs or glyph
classes in the backtrack and lookahead sequences.

The input sequence is defined by appending the mark (`'`) character to all the
glyph names and class names (and only these names) within the input sequence.
Applying the mark (`'`) character to keywords such as anchor and mark or a value
record will result in a syntax error.

<a name="6.h.ii"></a>
#### 6.h.ii. Specifying Contextual Positioning with explicit lookup references

The most general form of the contextual substitution rule is to explicitly
reference named lookups in the rule.

###### Example:
Define two standalone lookups (§[4.e](#4.e)), and then reference them in the
input sequence of contextual positioning rules with the keyword `lookup` and the
lookup name.

```fea
markClass [acute grave] <anchor 150 -10> @ALL_MARKS;

lookup CNTXT_PAIR_POS {
     position T o -10;
     position T c -12;
 } CNTXT_PAIR_POS;

lookup CNTXT_MARK_TO_BASE {
     position base o <anchor 250 450> mark @ALL_MARKS;
     position base c <anchor 250 450> mark @ALL_MARKS;
 } CNTXT_MARK_TO_BASE;

feature test {
     position T' lookup CNTXT_PAIR_POS [o c]' @ALL_MARKS' lookup CNTXT_MARK_TO_BASE;
 } test;
```

This rule has only an input sequence, and no backtrack or lookahead sequence. It
will match when the current glyph is 'T', followed by either 'o' or 'c',
followed by any mark glyph. The lookup CNTXT_PAIR_POS will applied to the 'T',
and the lookup CNTXT_MARK_TO_BASE will be applied to the glyphs in the class
@ALL_MARKS.

This form of the contextual positioning rule is the most flexible. You can
specify a positioning lookup for more than one input sequence glyph or glyph
class, the referenced lookups can be of different types, and the referenced
lookups can have different lookup flags that the parent contextual lookup. The
drawback is that it is difficult to understand what position rule will be
applied, and the implementation may not warn if the referenced lookup does not
contain a rule that matches the context.

When it is acceptable to specify a positioning rule for only one input glyph or
glyph class in the input sequence, and that the referenced lookup have the same
lookup flag as the parent contextual lookup, then you can specify a contextual
rule with the positioning rule in-line. This is much easier to understand.

<a name="6.h.iii"></a>
#### 6.h.iii. Specifying Contextual Positioning with in-line single positioning rules

###### Example 1:

```fea
position [quoteleft quotedblleft ][Y T]' <0 0 20 0> [quoteright quotedblright];
position [quoteleft quotedblleft ][Y T]' 20 [quoteright quotedblright];
```

Both of these rules have an input sequence of a single glyph position, for which
the glyph class [Y T] is specified. The marked glyph class is followed by a
value record. The first form shows a full value record which allows you to alter
both the (x,y) coordinates of the origin and the (x,y) coordinates of the
advance width. The second rule shows the simple form of the value record, which
specifies a value for only a change to the x value of the advance width. Note
that the value record modifies the glyph which it follows. These both increase
the advance width of Y or T by 20, when preceded by either quoteleft or
quotedblleft, and followed by quoteright or quotedblright. Note that not all
marked glyphs or glyph classes in the input sequence must be followed by a value
record; if this is omitted, then the item’s positioning info will not be
affected.

###### Example 2:

```fea
position s f' 10 t;
position s f' 10 t' -5 period;
```

The first example specifies a kern pair “ft” when preceded by “s”, and increases
the x-advance of f by 10. The second specifies a kern triplet “ft.”, when
preceded by “s”. The x-advance of f is increased by 10, and the x-advance of t
is decreased by 5. The entire run of marked glyphs will be consumed by a rule;
in the first case, after matching this rule, the set of rules in current lookup
will next be applied starting at the glyph “t”. In the second case, the rules
will next be applied starting at the glyph “period”.

**Special notes on contextual kerning**

Contextual positioning rules must be in a different lookup than pair positioning
rules, since the rules are of different lookup types. Because each lookup is
applied independently of the other lookup(s) over the entire text stream, the
positioning change specified in a pair kerning rule will be added to the
positioning change specified in a contextual kerning rule, whenever the two
rules match the same glyph pair in the text stream. This effect can be managed
by specifying the contextual kerning rules values so that the sum of the pair
positioning rule value and the contextual positioning rule value add to the
desired value, as in example 3A.

###### Example 3A:

```fea
position L quoteright -150;
position quoteright A -120;
position L' 50 quoteright' 70 A;
```

Desired final kern adjustment: `L' -100 quoteright' -50 A;`

In this example, the intended kern correction for the triplet “L quoteright A”
is an adjustment of -100 to the advance width of the L when followed by
quoteright, and of -50 to the advance width of quoteright when followed by A.
However, since the pair positioning rules will adjust the pair “L quoteright” by
-150 and the pair “quoteright A” by -120, the adjustment values in the
contextual rule for the triplet must be set as shown. This approach is feasible,
but difficult to understand.

Another approach is to simply make all the kerning be contextual by marking the
first glyph or glyph class of each pair positioning rule. Since all the kern
rules will then be in a single lookup, only one rule will match in any context,
and there is no need to figure out which rules add up. This solution is shown in
example 3B using feature file syntax for contextual positioning. Notice,
however, that the triplet rule has to be defined before the other two rules.
Otherwise, the pair positioning rules will block the triplet’s positioning 
adjustment.

###### Example 3B:

```fea
position L' -100 quoteright' -50 A;
position L' -150 quoteright;
position quoteright' -120 A;
position s f' 10 t period;
```

In order to make pair positioning rules easier to read and write as contextual
kern pairs, the feature file syntax will identify a special case of contextual
rule which contains only one marked glyph or glyph class, followed by one or
more unmarked glyph or glyph class, plus a value record. This will be treated as
a contextual pair positioning statement, and will be the only one case where a
value record may follow an unmarked glyph. Example 3B can thus be written as
example 3C. Both examples are exactly equivalent.

###### Example 3C:

```fea
position L' -100 quoteright' -50 A;
position L' quoteright -150;  # special cases of contextual positioning
position quoteright' A -120;  # where value record follows unmarked glyph,
position s f' t 10 period;    # making them exactly equivalent to 3B.
```

Note that the following statement (Example 3D) is NOT a pair kerning statement,
and would almost always be an error of intent.

###### Example 3D:

```fea
position L' quoteright' -150;
```

This statement does two things that are not desirable in pair kerning statement.
First, it decreases the advance width of quoteright, not L. Second, it will move
the current glyph pointer forward by 2 glyphs, skipping over the quoteright so
that quoteright will not be examined for matching kern rules.

The FEA syntax will not allow applying positioning lookups of different types in
one contextual rule. For example, if you want to position sukun over
lam_meem_jeem when followed by alef, and kern lam_meem_jeem with alef in this
context, you need to put the mark and kern rules in different lookups.

###### Example 4:

```fea
markClass sukun <anchor 0 0> @TOP_CLASS;

lookup MARK_POS {
    position base lam_meem_jeem' <anchor 625 1800> mark @TOP_CLASS alef;
} MARK_POS;

lookup MARK_KERN {
    position lam_meem_jeem' 5 @TOP_CLASS
    alef;
} MARK_KERN;
```

The rule in lookup MARK_POS will position sukun over lam_meem_jeem when followed
by alef. The second rule will add 5 to the advance width of lam_meem_jeem when
followed by sukun and then by alef.

###### Example 6:

```fea
lookup a_reduce_sb {
    pos a <-80 0 -160 0>;
} a_reduce_sb;

lookup a_raise {
    pos a <0 100 0 0>;
} a_raise;

feature kern {
    pos a' lookup a_reduce_sb lookup a_raise b;
} test;
```

In this example the rule in the kern feature will match the sequence “a b” and apply 
multiple lookups to the input “a”. The first lookup will subtract 80 units from the 
x placement and 160 units from the x advance of “a”. The second lookup will adjust 
the y placement of “a” by 100 units. 


###### Example 7:

```fea
lookup REPHA_SPACE {
    pos ka-gran <0 0 644 0>;
} REPHA_SPACE;

lookup ANUSVARA_SPACE {
    pos ka-gran <0 0 510 0>;
} ANUSVARA_SPACE;

lookup ADD70 {
    pos ka-gran <0 0 70 0>;
} ADD70;

lookup ADD_ADVANCE_WIDTH {
    pos ka-gran' lookup REPHA_SPACE lookup ANUSVARA_SPACE lookup ADD70 repha-gran anusvara-gran;
    pos ka-gran' lookup REPHA_SPACE lookup ADD70 repha-gran;
    pos ka-gran' lookup ANUSVARA_SPACE lookup ADD70 anusvara-gran;
} ADD_ADVANCE_WIDTH;

feature dist {
    lookup ADD_ADVANCE_WIDTH;
} dist;
```
In this example the rules in `ADD_ADVANCE_WIDTH` will match the sequences “ka-gran repha-gran anusvara-gran”, 
“ka-gran repha-gran”, or “ka-gran anusvara-gran” and apply multiple lookups to the input. Here
each lookup adds advance width to “ka-gran” based on the following glyphs. 

<a name="6.h.iv"></a>
#### 6.h.iv. Specifying Contextual Positioning with in-line cursive positioning rules

The contextual form of the cursive positioning rule consists of simply adding
contextual glyphs or glyph classes before the `cursive` keyword, and/or after
the anchors. The base glyph must be marked as part of the input sequence; the
others may or may not be marked.

```fea
position @BACKTRACK_GLYPHS_FOR_MEEM cursive
meem.medial' <anchor 500 20> <anchor 0 -20> @LOOKAHEAD_GLYPHS_FOR_MEEM;
```

<a name="6.h.v"></a>
#### 6.h.v. Specifying Contextual Positioning with in-line mark attachment positioning rules

For all three forms of the mark attachment rules - Mark-To-Base,
Mark-To-Ligature, and Mark-To-Mark - the contextual form of the positioning
rules consist of inserting glyph sequences in one or more of three places in the
rule:
   1. before the initial 'base | ligature | mark' keyword
   2. after the base glyph or glyph class
   3. after all the anchor-mark class clauses

At least one of the mark classes must be marked as part of the input sequence;
the other glyphs or glyph classes in the contextual sequence may or may not be
marked. There is special treatment of the mark classes. The implementation
creates a glyph class which is the input glyph class to which the positioning
lookup is applied. Each mark class that is marked as part of the input sequence
is added to this glyph class. If the rule has four mark classes, and three are
marked as part of the input sequence. the result is a single glyph class in the
input sequence which contains the glyphs from the three marked mark classes. The
base glyph or glyph class is also always added in the contextual sequence.

For example:

```fea
position [T V F] base [a e o u] <anchor 250 450> mark @TOP_MARKS'
                                <anchor 250 -10> mark @BOTTOM_MARKS' @VOWELS;
```

This contextual rule will match when the current context matches the 4 item
glyph sequence “[T V F] [a e o u] [top and bottom marks] @VOWELS”. The input
sequence has only one item, a glyph class which consists of all the glyphs from
the two mark classes.

<a name="6.h.vi"></a>
#### 6.h.vi. Specifying exceptions to the Chain Pos rule

Exceptions to a chaining contextual positioning rule are expressed by inserting
a statement of the following form anywhere before the chaining contextual rule
and in the same lookup:

```fea
ignore position <marked glyph sequence> (, <marked glyph sequence>)*;
```

This rule works in exactly the same was as specifying exceptions to a chaining
contextual substitution rule [§[5.f.ii](#5.f.ii)].

## 7. Ordering of lookups and rules in the feature file

<a name="7.a"></a>
### 7.a. An OpenType Layout engine’s layout algorithm

The following is a reference summary of the algorithm used by an OpenType layout
(OTL) engine to perform substitutions and positionings. The important aspect of
this for a feature file editor is that each lookup corresponds to one “pass”
over the glyph run (see step 4 below). Thus, each lookup has as input the
accumulated result of all previous lookups in the LookupList (whether in the
same feature or in other features).

1\.  All glyphs in the client’s glyph run must belong to the same language system.
    (Glyph sequence matching may not occur across language systems.)

----
Do the following first for the GSUB and then for the GPOS:

2\.  Assemble all features (including any required feature) for the glyph run’s
language system.

3\.  Assemble all lookups in these features, in LookupList order, removing any
    duplicates. (All features and thus all lookups needn't be applied to every glyph
    in the run.)

4\.  For each lookup:

5\.  For each glyph in the glyph run:

6\.  If the lookup is applied to that glyph and the lookupflag doesn't indicate
    that that glyph is to be ignored:

7\.  For each subtable in the lookup:

8\.  If the subtable’s target context is matched:

9\.  Do the glyph substitution or positioning,

----
OR:

If this is a (chain) contextual lookup do the following [(10)-(11)] in the
subtable’s Subst/PosLookupRecord order:

10\. For each (sequenceIndex, lookupListIndex) pair:

11\. Apply lookup[lookupListIndex] at input sequence[sequenceIndex]
    [steps(7)-(11)]

12\. Goto the glyph after the input sequence matched in (8)
    (i.e. skip any remaining subtables in the lookup).

The “target context” in step 8 above comprises the input sequence and any
backtrack and lookahead sequences.

The input sequence must be matched entirely within the lookup’s “application
range” at that glyph (that contiguous subrun of glyphs including and around the
current glyph on which the lookup is applied). There is no such restriction on
the backtrack and lookahead sequences.

“Matching” includes matching any glyphs designated to be skipped in the lookup’s
LookupFlag.

<a name="7.b"></a>
### 7.b. Ordering of lookups and subtables

A lookup in the OpenType font will be created from each named lookup block
[§[4.e](#4.e)] or each run of rules with the same feature, script, language,
lookupflag and lookup type attribute.

Lookups will be created in the GSUB/GPOS table’s LookupList in the same order as
the corresponding named lookup blocks or runs of rules in the feature file,
except for the lookups that comprise the `aalt` feature. These will always be
created before all other features [§[8.a](#8.a)].

A lookup may contain one or more subtables. Subtable breaks may have been
inserted by the implementation software due to format restrictions, or they may
have been explicitly requested by the editor [§[4.f](#4.f)]. In either case,
subtables will be created in the same order as the corresponding subtables in
the feature file, if the order is relevant to OT layout. If the order is
irrelevant, the implementation may choose to order subtables within a lookup in
any manner.

Note that the lookup sharing mechanism (i.e. a `lookup` reference statement that
refers to a named lookup block) is implemented simply by referring to the
LookupList index of the lookup as many times as needed in the Feature tables.

<a name="7.c"></a>
### 7.c. Ordering of rules within a lookup

In the feature file, the ordering of rules within a lookup is important only for
chaining contextual substitution and chaining contextual positioning rules. This
is because in all other cases of LookupTypes (including ligature substitutions,
see [§[5.d](#5.d)]), the appropriate ordering is automatically deduced, and the
implementation sorts the rules accordingly when writing them to the font file.

<a name="8"></a>
## 8. Specially handled features

<a name="8.a"></a>
### 8.a. The all alternates feature (`aalt`)

The `aalt` feature consists of a feature definition block which contains a
series of statements in the form:

```fea
feature <feature tag>;
```

followed by one or more single and alternates substitution rules.

The feature file parser should create the `aalt` feature from the feature file
definition as follows:

1.  Considering only features indicated by:

    `feature <feature tag>;`

    in the `aalt` specification feature block (see example below), combine all
    single and alternate substitutions in those features (including single
    substitutions that appear within a chaining contextual rule) into groups
    with the first glyph in the group being the target glyph of the
    substitution. Subsequent elements of the group will be ordered by the order
    of the relevant rule in the feature file. Duplicate glyphs will be removed.

    The `aalt` feature block must appear before the feature block of any
    `<feature tag>` it references in the above manner. It will also always be
    created as the first feature in the font (i.e. its lookups will be at the
    beginning of the GSUB LookupList).

2.  Add any additional single and alternate substitutions in the `aalt`
    specification to the groups that were created algorithmically, by step 1. This
    facility is provided to fine-tune the semantic groups, for instance, if certain
    glyphs weren't referenced in any of the features indicated in step 1 above. This
    can also be used to override substitutions specified by including other
    features: for any target glyph, the alternate glyphs specified by this mechanism
    precede in order any other alternate glyphs.

3.  If there are only two glyphs in a group, create a single substitution in the
    `aalt` feature, with the first glyph being the target glyph and the second glyph
    being the replacement glyph. If there are more than two glyphs in a group,
    create an alternate substitution in the `aalt` feature, with the first glyph
    being the target glyph and the remaining glyphs being the alternate set. These
    alternate glyphs will be sorted in the order that the source features are named
    in the `aalt` definition, _not_ the order of the feature definitions in the
    file. Alternates defined explicitly, as in step 2 above, will precede all
    others.

###### The `useExtension` keyword:

The `useExtension` keyword may optionally precede `{` in the feature block
syntax. The `aalt` lookups will be created with the GSUB Extension lookup type
if and only if the `useExtension` keyword is used. Note that since the Extension
lookup types were added in OpenType specification v1.3, they will not be
recognized by all OpenType layout parsers.

###### Specifying language system:

This feature will be registered under all language systems specified by
`languagesystem` statements; see §[4.b.i](#4.b.i) above.

The following are not allowed in the `aalt` feature definition: `script`,
`language`, `lookupflag`, and `subtable` statements; named lookup blocks and
lookup reference statements. The `aalt` lookups will be created with LookupFlag
0.

_Examples:_

```fea
languagesystem DFLT dflt;
languagesystem latn dflt;
languagesystem latn TRK;
languagesystem cyrl dflt;

feature aalt {
    feature salt;
    feature smcp;
    substitute d by d.alt;
} aalt;

feature smcp {
    sub [a-c] by [A.sc-C.sc];
    sub f i by f_i;     # not considered for aalt
} smcp;

feature salt {
    sub a from [a.alt1 a.alt2 a.alt3];
    sub e [c d e]' f by [c.mid d.mid e.mid];
    sub b by b.alt;
} salt;
```

The `aalt` lookups from the above example will be registered under the default
language systems of the `DFLT`, `latn` and `cyrl` scripts, and also under the
`latn`/`TRK ` language systems. The `aalt` created would be the same as if the
font editor had specified:

```fea
feature aalt {
    sub a from [a.alt1 a.alt2 a.alt3 A.sc];
    sub b from [b.alt B.sc];
    sub c from [c.mid C.sc];
    sub d from [d.alt d.mid];
    sub e by e.mid;
} aalt;
```

The following example will result in the `aalt` lookups being created with the
GSUB Extension lookup type:

```fea
feature aalt useExtension {
    feature salt;
    feature smcp;
    substitute d by d.alt;
    # ... other rules
} aalt;
```

<a name="8.b"></a>
### 8.b. The optical size feature (`size`)

This feature is unique in that it contains no substitution or positioning rules
(the LookupCount field in its Feature table will always be 0).

The feature’s data is accessed instead through the FeatureParams value of its
Feature table.

Thus, the syntax for this feature is different from all other features. The
feature block must contain:

* one `parameters` statement
* and zero or more `sizemenuname` statements.

No other feature file statements, blocks or keywords are permitted. (Comments
are allowed.)

This feature will be created in the GPOS table and will be registered under all
language systems specified by `languagesystem` statements (see §[4.b.i](#4.b.i)
above).

For example:

```fea
feature size {
    parameters 100  # design size (decipoints)
                 3  # subfamily identifier
                80  # range start (exclusive, decipoints)
               139; # range end (inclusive, decipoints)
    sizemenuname "Win MinionPro Size Name";
    sizemenuname 1 "Mac MinionPro Size Name";
    sizemenuname 1 21 0 "Mac MinionPro Size Name";
} size;
```

See the OpenType feature tag registry for a description of the `parameters`
statement fields. “decipoints” is a unit of 1/10 of a point.

These values may also be specified more directly as decimal point values, but a
decimal point and following value is then required. For example, “8.0” and “80”
will both result in the same value being stored in the font.

The parameter `sizemenuname` provides the menu name to be used for a group of
fonts with the same subfamily identifier.

If the font is part of such a group, then the `sizemenuname` statement must be
provided in order for the members of the group to be grouped together in a
sub-menu under the specified menu name.

In this case, we strongly recommend providing at least the two entries for
Windows and Macintosh platform Roman script name strings. You may also include
any another localized name strings that may be useful.

If the font is not part of such a group, then the `sizemenuname` statements must
be omitted, and all fields but the first (design size) for the parameter
statement must be set to 0. This form may be abbreviated by setting the
subfamily identifier to 0, and omitting the two remaining zeros. For example:

```fea
parameters 10.0 0;  # Indicate intended design size to be 10 pts.
```

This can be used to indicate the intended design size for a font, even when it
is not part of an optical size group.

The syntax of the `sizemenuname` statement follows that of the name table name
strings, as described in §[9.e](#9.e).

The names specified by the `sizemenuname` statement are actually stored in the
name table, with name IDs starting at the first unused name ID at or after 256.

### 8.c. Descriptive names for Stylistic Set features (`ss01` - `ss20`)

As of the OpenType specification 1.6, descriptive names are allowed for
stylistic substitution features. These names are specified within a feature
block for a Stylistic Set feature. The implementation will store the name
strings in the name table, and will create a feature parameter data block which
references them.

A single Stylistic Set feature block may contain more than one descriptive name
in order to support different languages. These names are defined within a
`featureNames` block that must be inside the stylistic set feature block, and
must precede any of the rules in the feature. The syntax for a `featureNames`
block is:

```fea
featureNames {
    name <platform ID> <script ID> <language ID> <text string>;
    # This name entry is repeated for every script and language to be supported.
};
```

The syntax for the individual name string entries is similar to that of the
name table nameID entries (see §[9.e](#9.e)) - the only difference is that the
introductory keyword is `name`, and the name ID value is omitted, since the
nameID value is auto-generated by the feature compiler.

###### Example:

```fea
feature ss01 {
    featureNames {
        name "Feature description for MS Platform, script Unicode, language English";
        # Without platform ID, script ID, or language ID specified,
        # the implementation assumes (3,1,0x409).

        name 3 1 0x411 "Feature description for MS Platform, script Unicode, language Japanese";
        name 1 "Feature description for Apple Platform, script Roman, language unspecified";
        # When only platform ID is specified, the implementation assumes script and language
        # is Latin. For Apple this is (1,0,0).

        name 1 1 12 "Feature description for Apple Platform, script Japanese, language Japanese";
    };
        # --- rules for this feature ---
} ss01;
```

<a name="8.d"></a>
### 8.d. UI Label names for Character Variant features (`cv01` - `cv99`)

As of the OpenType specification 1.6, UI label names are allowed for Character
Variant features. These names are specified within the feature block for a
Character Variant feature. The implementation will store the name strings in the
name table, and will create a feature parameter data block which references
them.

A set of NameID entries are specified within a parameter block entry. The
parameter block must precede any of the rules in the feature. There are four
distinct NameID entry types. The `ParamUILabelNameID` entry may be omitted or
repeated as often as needed. The other NameID types may be omitted, or defined
only once. The NameID entries must be specified in the order listed below. A
single Character Variant NameID entry may contain more than one name string
entry in order to support different languages and platforms.

Following the set of NameID entries, a series of 24 bit Unicode values may be
specified. These provide Unicode values for the base glyphs referenced by the
feature. The developer may specify none, some, or all of the Unicode values for
the base glyphs. The Unicode value may be written with either decimal or
hexadecimal notation: the value must be preceded by '0x' if it is a hexadecimal
value. The 24 bit field means that the largest Unicode value allowed is ((1<<24)
-1), aka, 0xFFFFFF

The intent of the NameID entries is described in the OpenType spec document:
[OpenType Layout tag registry — section on feature tags, tag name `cv01` -
`cv99`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/features_ae#cv01-cv99).

**Note:** The `ParamUILabelNameID` entries are used when one base glyph is mapped
to more than one variant; the font designer may then specify one
`ParamUILabelNameID` for each variant, in order to uniquely describe that
variant. If any `ParamUILabelNameID` entries are specified, the number of
`ParamUILabelNameID` entries must match the number of variants for each base
glyph. If the Character Variant feature specifies more than one base glyph, then
the set of NameID entries in the parameter block will be used for each base
glyph and its variants.

The syntax for a `cvParameters` block is:

```fea
cvParameters {
    FeatUILabelNameID {
        name <platform ID> <script ID> <language ID> <text string>;
    };
    FeatUITooltipTextNameID {
        name <platform ID> <script ID> <language ID> <text string>;
    };
    SampleTextNameID {
        name <platform ID> <script ID> <language ID> <text string>;
    };
    ParamUILabelNameID {
        name <platform ID> <script ID> <language ID> <text string>;
    };

    Character <Unicode value string>;
};
```

The syntax for the individual name string entries within a NameID entry is
similar to that of the name table nameID entries (see §[9.e](#9.e)) - the only
difference is that the introductory keyword is `name`, and the name ID value is
omitted, since the nameID value is auto-generated by the feature compiler.

###### Example:

```fea
feature cv01 {

    cvParameters {

        FeatUILabelNameID {
            name 3 1 0x0409 "uilabel simple a";  # English US
            name 1 0 0 "uilabel simple a";  # Mac English
        };

        FeatUITooltipTextNameID {
            name 3 1 0x0409 "tool tip simple a";  # English US
            name 1 0 0 "tool tip simple a";  # Mac English
        };

        SampleTextNameID {
            name 3 1 0x0409 "sample text simple a";  # English US
            name 1 0 0 "sample text simple a";  # Mac English
        };

        ParamUILabelNameID {
            name 3 1 0x0409 "param1 text simple a";  # English US
            name 1 0 0 "param1 text simple a";  # Mac English
        };

        ParamUILabelNameID {
            name 3 1 0x0409 "param2 text simple a";  # English US
            name 1 0 0 "param2 text simple a";  # Mac English
        };

        Character 10;
        Character 0x5DDE;

    };

    # --- rules for this feature ---
} cv01;
```

## 9. Specifying or overriding table values

In addition to GSUB and GPOS OpenType layout features, the feature file syntax
enables specifying or overriding values in certain other tables. These are
specified within the corresponding table block:

```fea
table <table tag> {
    # ...
} <table tag>;
```

The following table values are currently supported:

<a name="9.a"></a>
### 9.a. BASE table

If no BASE table entry is specified in the feature file, no BASE table is
created in the OpenType font.

```fea
table BASE {
    HorizAxis.BaseTagList <baseline tag>+;
    HorizAxis.BaseScriptList <script record> (, <script record>)*;
    HorizAxis.MinMax <minmax record>;

    VertAxis.BaseTagList <baseline tag>+;
    VertAxis.BaseScriptList <script record> (, <script record>)*;
    VertAxis.MinMax <minmax record>;
} BASE;
```

A `<script record>` is of the form:

```fea
<script tag> <default baseline tag> <base coord>+
```

`<base coord>` can take several formats: _[ Currently only format A is implemented ]_

```fea
# Format A
<number>

# Format B
<number> <glyph> <number>

# Format C
<number> <device>
```

The baseline tags for each `BaseTagList` must be sorted in increasing ASCII
order.

The number of baseline values for a particular script should be the same as
the number of baseline tags in the corresponding `BaseTagList`.

A `<minmax record>` _[ currently not implemented ]_ is of the form:

```fea
<script tag> <language tag>  # Defines the language system
    <base coord>,            # Min value for this language system
    <base coord>             # Max value for this language system
    [,
    <feature tag>            # (Optional) feature tag
    <base coord>,            # Min value for this feature tag
    <base coord>]            # Max value for this feature tag
    ;
```

An example of a simple BASE table is:

```fea
table BASE {
    HorizAxis.BaseTagList     ideo romn;
    HorizAxis.BaseScriptList  latn   romn   -120    0, cyrl   romn   -120    0,
                              grek   romn   -120    0, hani   ideo   -120    0,
                              kana   ideo   -120    0, hang   ideo   -120    0;
} BASE;
```

<a name="9.b"></a>
### 9.b. GDEF table

```fea
table GDEF {
    GlyphClassDef <glyphclass>*,  # base glyphs
                  <glyphclass>*,  # ligature glyphs
                  <glyphclass>*,  # mark glyphs
                  <glyphclass>;   # component glyphs
    Attach        <glyph|glyphclass> <number>+; # <number> is a contour point index

    LigatureCaretByDev # Currently not implemented
    LigatureCaretByPos <glyph|glyphclass> <caret position value>+;
    LigatureCaretByIndex <glyph|glyphclass> <caret contour point index value>+;
} GDEF;
```

The number of `<caret value>`s specified for a LigatureCaret must be: (number of
ligature components) - 1.

Only one `LigatureCaret` rule may be specified per glyph, whether it is
`LigatureCaretByPos` or `LigatureCaretByIndex`.

Here is an example of a GDEF table block:

```fea
table GDEF {
    GlyphClassDef @BASE, @LIGATURES, @MARKS, @COMPONENT;
    Attach noon.final 5;
    Attach noon.initial 4;
    LigatureCaretByPos f_f_l 400 600;
    LigatureCaretByPos [c_t c_s] 500;
    LigatureCaretByIndex f_f_i 23 46;
} GDEF;
```

The four class names following `GlyphClassDef` must be separated by commas. Any
classes can be omitted, but all the commas are required. According to the OpenType
specification, any glyph not included in one of the class definitions will be
assigned glyph class index 0, and will not be included in any of the `GlyphClassDef`
classes.

The **MarkAttachment** classes of the GDEF table may not be specified explicitly in
feature file syntax. They are instead created by the implementation from use of
the `lookupflag MarkAttachmentType <class name>` statements. The class names may
be from either regular classes definitions or mark class definitions.

The **MarkGlyphSets** classes of the GDEF table may not be specified explicitly in
feature file syntax. They are instead created by the implementation from use of
the `lookupflag UseMarkFilteringSet <class name>` statements. The class names
may be from either regular classes definitions or mark class definitions.

If any mark class has been defined, or if any of the lookup flags for skipping
glyphs of a certain class have been seen, the implementation will check if the
GDEF keywords for defining the `GlyphClassDef` has been seen. If not, the
implementation will fill them from the substitution and positioning rules, and
will create a GDEF table even if there is no GDEF definition in the feature
file. The LIGATURE and COMPONENT classes will be filled from the glyphs used in
any GSUB Lookup Type 4, Ligature Substitution. The MARKS class will be filled
from all the glyphs in any of the mark classes used in positioning rules.

### 9.c. head table

The head table `FontRevision` value is used as the overall font version number,
and should be incremented whenever any data in the fonts is changed. It is both
specified and reported as a decimal number with three significant decimal
places. The actual value stored in the font will, however, be a Fixed number
(16.16 bit format). Due to the limited precision of this format, the value
stored may differ by a small decimal fraction from that specified, but will
always round to the same value when rounded to three fractional decimal places.

This value is also used as the source for the font version string in the name
table name string ID 5 “Version”.

```fea
table head {
    FontRevision <fixed point number with three fractional decimal places>;
} head;
```

###### Example 1:

```fea
table head {
    FontRevision 1.1;
} head;
```

This format is supported, but will cause a warning that the specification will
be converted to “1.100”. It will be stored in the font as 0x0001199A. A more
exact decimal representation would be 1.10000610352, but it will be reported as
“1.100”.

###### Example 2:

```fea
table head {
    FontRevision 1.001;
} head;
```

This value be stored in the font as 0x00010042. A more exact decimal
representation is 1.001007, but it will be reported as “1.001”.

###### Example 3:

```fea
table head {
    FontRevision 1.500;
} head;
```

This value be stored in the font as 0x00018000, and will be reported as “1.500”.
The decimal and Fixed values are equal in this case.

### 9.d. hhea table

```fea
table hhea {
    CaretOffset <metric>;
    Ascender <metric>;
    Descender <metric>;
    LineGap <metric>;
} hhea;
```

For example:

```fea
table hhea {
    CaretOffset -50;
    Ascender 800;
    Descender 200;
    LineGap 200;
} hhea;
```

<a name="9.e"></a>
### 9.e. name table

```fea
table name {
    # name records
} name;
```

A name record is of the form:

```fea
nameid <id> [<string attribute>] <string>;
```

An `<id>` is a number specifying the ID of the name string to be added to the
name table. Note that IDs 2 and 6 (Family, Subfamily, Unique, Full, Version, and
FontName) are reserved by the implementation and cannot be overridden; doing so
will elicit a warning message and the record will be ignored.

An optional `<string attribute>` is one or three space delimited numbers that
specify the platform, platform-specific, and language IDs to be stored in the
name record of the name table. If only one number is specified it represents the
platform ID. The platform ID may be either 1 or 3, corresponding to the
Macintosh or Microsoft (hereafter called Windows) platforms, respectively. The
other ID numbers must be in the range 0-65535 but are not otherwise validated.

Consult the OpenType specification to obtain
[Windows platform IDs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/name#windows-encoding-ids),
[Windows language IDs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/name#windows-language-ids),
[Macintosh platform IDs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/name#macintosh-encoding-ids-script-manager-codes) and
[Macintosh language IDs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/name#macintosh-language-ids).

Decimal numbers must begin with a non-0 digit, octal numbers with a 0 digit, and
hexadecimal numbers with a 0x prefix to numbers and hexadecimal letters a-f or
A-F.

If some or all of the string attribute ID numbers aren't specified their values
are defaulted as follows:

```fea
platform id      3 (Windows)
```

Windows platform selected:

```fea
platspec id      1 (Unicode)
language id 0x0409 (Windows default English)
```

Macintosh platform selected:

```fea
platspec id      0 (Roman)
language id      0 (English)
```

Putting this all together gives the following valid nameID formats and the IDs
that are assigned.

    representation              id  platform id platspec id language id
    --------------------------- --- ----------- ----------- -----------
    nameid 1 <string>;          1   3           1           0x0409
    nameid 1 3 <string>;        1   3           1           0x0409
    nameid 1 3 S L <string>;    1   3           S           L
    nameid 1 1 <string>;        1   1           0           0
    nameid 1 1 S L <string>;    1   1           S           L

A string is composed of UTF-8 characters enclosed by ASCII double quote
characters (`"`). Newlines embedded within the string are removed from the
character sequence to be stored.

Strings are converted to UTF-16 for the Windows platform. Unicode values for
the Windows platform may also be specified using a special character sequence
of a backslash character (`\`) followed by exactly four hexadecimal numbers (of
either case) which may not all be zero, e.g. \4e2d.  The ASCII backslash
character must be represented as the sequence \005c or \005C and the ASCII
double quote character must be represented as the sequence \0022.

There is no corresponding conversion to Unicode for the Macintosh platform but
character codes in the range 128-255 may be specified using a special character
sequence of a backslash character (`\`) followed by exactly two hexadecimal
numbers (of either case) which may not both be zero, e.g. \83. The ASCII
backslash character must be represented as the sequence \5c or \5C and the ASCII
double quote character must be represented as the sequence \22.

###### Example (add designer’s name that includes non-ASCII characters for Mac and Windows platforms):

```fea
table name {
    nameid 9 "Joachim Müller-Lancé";            # Windows (Unicode), UTF-8 input
} name;
```

```fea
table name {
    nameid 9 "Joachim M\00fcller-Lanc\00e9";    # Windows (Unicode), escaped Unicode values
    nameid 9 1 "Joachim M\9fller-Lanc\8e";      # Macintosh (Mac Roman)
} name;
```

<a name="9.f"></a>
### 9.f. OS/2 table

```fea
table OS/2 {
    FSType <number>;
    Panose <panose number>;
    UnicodeRange <Unicode range list>;
    CodePageRange <code page list>;
    TypoAscender <metric>;
    TypoDescender <metric>;
    TypoLineGap <metric>;
    winAscent <metric>;
    winDescent <metric>;
    XHeight <metric>;
    CapHeight <metric>;
    WeightClass <number>;
    WidthClass <number>;
    Vendor <string>;
    LowerOpSize <number>;
    UpperOpSize <number>;
    FamilyClass <number>;
} OS/2;
```

`Vendor` should be 4 characters long. If a shorter vendor ID is given, it is
automatically padded with spaces. A longer vendor ID causes an error.

`<panose number>` is ten (decimal) numbers separated by spaces.

`<Unicode range list>` is a space-separated list of Unicode bit numbers from the
OpenType specification for the [**ulUnicodeRange1-4** in the OS/2 table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#ur).

`<code page list>` is a space-separated list of Windows code page numbers from the
OpenType specification for the [**ulCodePageRange1-2** in the OS/2 table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#cpr).

`LowerOpSize` and `UpperOpSize` set the **usLowerOpticalPointSize** and
**usUpperOpticalPointSize** fields. If these are set, then the OS/2 version must be
set to at least 5 by the implementation. Note that the values for these fields
are set in units of TWIPS, or 20 × point size.

`FamilyClass` is a single numeric value (decimal, hexadecimal, or octal) to
set the
[**sFamilyClass**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#sfamilyclass)
field. FamilyClass is conceptually 2 fields (class and subclass), so it's often
easier to think about and express as hexadecimal since that format nicely divides the class from subclass,
i.e. 0x0805 means Class=8 (Sans Serif), Subclass=5 (Neo-grotesque Gothic). See the [OpenType
Specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/ibmfc)
for valid values for class/subclass. _NOTE: `makeotfexe` does not make any
attempt to validate the supplied value beyond ensuring that the supplied value fits into two bytes._

###### Example:

```fea
table OS/2 {
    FSType 4;
    Panose 2 15 0 0 2 2 8 2 9 4;
    TypoAscender 800;
    TypoDescender -200; # Note that TypoDescender is negative for descent below the baseline.
    winAscent 832;
    winDescent 321; # Note that winDescent is positive for descent below the baseline.
    UnicodeRange
        0   # Basic Latin
        1   # Latin-1 Supplement
        9   # Cyrillic
        55  # CJK Compatibility
        59  # CJK Unified Ideographs
        60  # Private Use Area
        ;
    CodePageRange
        1252    # Latin 1
        1251    # Cyrillic
        932     # JIS/Japan
        ;
    XHeight 400;
    CapHeight 600;
    WeightClass 800;
    WidthClass 3;
    Vendor "ADBE";
    FamilyClass 0x0805;  # Class 8 (Sans-serif), Subclass 5 (Neo-grotesque Gothic)
} OS/2;
```

Note that for the codepage ranges, the list numbers may be separated by any
amount of white space. Note that the terminal semicolon cannot follow a comment
character on a line, as all text on a line following the comment character is
removed before processing.

### 9.g. vhea table

```fea
table vhea {
    VertTypoAscender <number>;
    VertTypoDescender <number>;
    VertTypoLineGap <number>;
} vhea;
```

For example:

```fea
table vhea {
    VertTypoAscender 500;
    VertTypoDescender -500;
    VertTypoLineGap 1000;
} vhea;
```

<a name="9.h"></a>
### 9.h. vmtx table

In OpenType, each glyph may have a unique vertical origin y coordinate and a
unique vertical advance width. By default, for each glyph the vertical origin y
coordinate is set to the value of the **OS/2.TypoAscender** field, and the vertical
advance width is set to the distance between the values of the of
**OS/2.TypoAscender** and the **OS/2.TypoDescender**. However, other values may be
assigned to a glyph as follows:

```fea
table vmtx {
    VertOriginY <glyph> <number1>;
    VertAdvanceY <glyph> <number2>;
} vmtx;
```

This would result in the glyph’s vertical origin y coordinate and the glyph’s
vertical advance width being set as shown. The value set here for the vertical
origin y coordinate will also set the **topSideBearing** value in the `vmtx` table
and the vertical origin y value in the `VORG` table for the named glyph.

For example:

```fea
table vmtx {
    VertOriginY \711 864;
    VertOriginY \712 867;
    VertOriginY \713 866;
} vmtx;
```

A special case for the vertical advance width is the set of glyphs referenced by
the `vrt2` feature. The default vertical advance for these glyphs is the
horizontal advance of their corresponding target (upright) glyphs. These values
will also be overridden by `VertAdvanceY` values.

<a name="9.i"></a>
### 9.i. STAT table
The STAT table is organized as follows:

```fea
table STAT {
    # Elided fallback name
    # Design axes
    # Axis values
} STAT;
```

#### Elided fallback name
Elided fallback name must be defined and at most once. It can be
defined using full name entries or an existing name ID.

```fea
ElidedFallbackName {
    name <name spec>;+
};
```

The syntax for the individual name string entries is similar to that of the
name table `nameID` entries (see §[9.e](#9.e)) - the only difference is that
the introductory keyword is `name`, and the name ID value is omitted, since the
name ID value is auto-generated by the feature compiler.

Alternatively, if the name string matches one of the pre-existing names in the
`name` table, the name ID can be specified directly and it must be be present
in the `name` table.

```fea
ElidedFallbackNameID <name ID>;
```

#### Design axes
All of the design axes defined in the `fvar` table must be present in the `STAT`
table as well, but the order is not required to be the same. The `STAT` table 
may also contain additional design axes not defined in the `fvar`.

```fea
DesignAxis <axisTag> <axisOrdering> {
    name <name spec>;+
};+
```

`axisTag` is a four-letter tag. `axisOrdering` is a signed number.

The syntax for individual name string entries is the same as above.

#### Axis values
There can be one or more axis values specified in the `STAT` table.

```fea
AxisValue {
    flag <FLAG>+ ;
    name <name string>;+
    location ...;+
};+
```

`flag` is optional, and defaults to 0 when omitted. Possible flags are
`ElidableAxisValueName` and `OlderSiblingFontAttribute`, and more than one flag
can be specified, for example:


```fea
flag ElidableAxisValueName OlderSiblingFontAttribute;
```

The `location` statement takes several formats:

##### location format A (used in Axis value table [Format 1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/stat#axis-value-table-format-1) and [Format 4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/stat#axis-value-table-format-4))
```fea
location <axisTag> <value>;+
```

`axisTag` is a 4-letter tag and must correspond to one of the defined design
axes in the table. `value` is a signed number specified as decimal (with
optional fractional part) in the range -32767.0 to +32767.99998.

With a single `location` statement the `AxisValue` will be format 1.
If there are more than one `location` statements the `AxisValue` will be 
format 4.

##### location format B (used in Axis value table [Format 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/stat#axis-value-table-format-2))
```fea
location <axisTag> <nominalValue> <rangeMinValue> <rangeMaxValue>;
```

Format for `axisTag` and the other values as above. To specify an open ended 
range use `-32767` to mean negative infinity and `32767.99998` to mean positive infinity. 
For example, the following AxisValue definitions mean that "Regular" on the 
`wght` axis is defined with a nominal value of 400 and a range covering all 
possible values below 400 up to and including 649. "Bold" is defined with a 
nominal value of 700 and a range covering all values from 650 and above. 
```fea
   AxisValue {
      location wght 400 -32768 650;
      name "Regular";
   AxisValue {
      location wght 700 650 32767.99998;
      name "Bold";
   };
```

There can be only one `location` statement when this format is used (the axis
value will be `STAT` format 2 `AxisValue`).

##### location format C (used in Axis value table [Format 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/stat#axis-value-table-format-3))
```fea
location <axisTag> <value> <linkedValue>;
```

Format for `axisTag` and the other values as above.

In the following example the `linkedValue` is used to style-link "Regular" and "Bold". 

```fea
   AxisValue {
      location wght 400 700;
      name "Regular";
   AxisValue {
      location wght 700;
      name "Bold";
   };
```

There can be only one `location` statement when this format is used (the axis
value will be `STAT` format 3 `AxisValue`).

#### Example 1:
These examples are for illustrative purposes only; they won’t all be in a 
single STAT table. See Example 2 for a fully defined STAT table. 

```fea
table STAT {
    ElidedFallbackName { name "Regular"; };

    DesignAxis wght 0 { name "Weight"; };
    DesignAxis ital 1 { name "Italic"; };

    # format 1
    AxisValue {
        location wght 400;
        name "Regular";
        name 3 1 0x411 "\5B9A\671F\7684";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    # format 2
    AxisValue {
        location wght 400 300 500;
        name "Regular";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    # format 3
    AxisValue {
        location wght 400 700;
        name "Regular";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    # format 3
    AxisValue {
        location ital 0 1;
        name "Regular";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    # format 4
    AxisValue {
        location wght 500;
        location ital 1;
        name "MediumItalic";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };
} STAT;
```
#### Example 2:
This example shows two fully defined STAT tables with three axes in format 2.
These link an Upright variable font and an Italic variable font with the `ital`
axis. 

For Upright:
```fea
table STAT {

   ElidedFallbackName { name "Regular"; };

   DesignAxis opsz 0 { name "Optical Size"; };
   DesignAxis wght 1 { name "Weight"; };
   DesignAxis ital 2 { name "Italic"; };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 200 200 250;
        name "ExtraLight";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 300 250 350;
        name "Light";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 400 350 450;
        name "Regular";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 500 450 550;
        name "Medium";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 600 550 650;
        name "Semibold";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 700 650 750;
        name "Bold";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 800 750 850;
        name "ExtraBold";
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location wght 900 850 900;
        name "Black";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location opsz 6 5 8;
        name "Caption";
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location opsz 10 8 24;
        name "Text";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location opsz 60 24 100;
        name "Display";
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location ital 0 1;
        name "Roman";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

} STAT;
```

For Italic:
```fea
table STAT {

   ElidedFallbackName { name "Italic"; };

   DesignAxis opsz 0 { name "Optical Size"; };
   DesignAxis wght 1 { name "Weight"; };
   DesignAxis ital 2 { name "Italic"; };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 200 200 250;
        name "ExtraLight";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 300 250 350;
        name "Light";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 400 350 450;
        name "Regular";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 500 450 550;
        name "Medium";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 600 550 650;
        name "Semibold";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 700 650 750;
        name "Bold";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location wght 800 750 850;
        name "ExtraBold";
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location wght 900 850 900;
        name "Black";
    };

    AxisValue {
        location opsz 6 5 8;
        name "Caption";
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location opsz 10 8 24;
        name "Text";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location opsz 60 24 100;
        name "Display";
    };
    
    AxisValue {
        location ital 1 0;
        name "Italic";
        flag ElidableAxisValueName;
    };

} STAT;
```

## 10. Specifying anonymous data blocks

The feature file can contain `anonymous` tagged blocks of data that must be
passed back to the client of the implementation software. These blocks of data
typically contain information needed to specify custom or unsupported tables.
The parser will not attempt to parse the data. Each such block is specified as
follows:

```fea
anonymous <tag> {
    # ...
} <tag>;
```

**Note:** The keyword `anonymous` can be abbreviated as `anon`. For example:

```fea
anon sbit {
    /* sbit table specifications */
    72  % dpi
    sizes {
        10, 12, 14 source {
            all "Generic/JGeneric"
        }
    }
} sbit;
```

The closing brace, tag, and semicolon must all be on the same line to indicate
the end of the anonymous block to the parser. White space may be used between
tokens on this line, and a comment may follow the semicolon. The `include`
directive will not be recognized within the block, starting from `anonymous` and
ending at the end of the closing line, so the entire block must exist within the
same file.

The data that is passed back to the client starts at the beginning of the line
after the opening brace and ends at (and includes) the newline before the
closing brace. In the example above, the client is passed back the following
data:

```fea
/* sbit table specifications */
72  % dpi
sizes {
   10, 12, 14 source {
      all "Generic/JGeneric"
   }
}
```

along with the tag `sbit`.

*   Fixed minor typos.

**v1.5 [23 November 2005]:**

*   Expanded documentation of languagesystem, script, and language keywords to
    describe newly added support for DFLT script, and correctly describe
    handling of `dflt` lookups.
*   Added OS/2 keywords winAscent, winDescent, and hhea keywords Ascender,
    Descender, and LineGap.

*   in GPOS positioning statements, allow single value for value record in
    all positioning statements; the case of all but pair positioning statements,
    this stands for a change to the x-advance of the preceding glyph name.

**v1.4 [23 January 2003; supported by HOT library v01.00.36]:**

*   Added new vmtx table overrides, in order to permit setting vertical metrics
    for pre-rotated proportional glyphs that are specifically designed and are
    not simply rotated forms of proportional glyphs.
*   Added new OS/2 overrides to set the Unicode and Windows code page range fields:

    *   UnicodeRange
    *   CodePageRange

*   Updated language keywords to be consistent with OpenType spec, i.e using
    `dflt` instead of `DFLT`. Expanded section explaining use of language and
    script default keywords. Old keywords still work, but cause a warning
    to be emitted.

**v1.3 [23 May 2002]:**

*   Added support for Vendor tag in OS/2 table.

**v1.2 [7 March 2001; HOT library v01.00.29]:**

*   Replaced `except` clause by separate `ignore substitute` or `ignore
    position` statement; e.g. from `except a @LET sub a by a.end;` to `do not
    sub a @LET; sub a' by a.end;`. (Note that the second rule is now required to
    be marked to identify it as a Chain Sub and not a Single Sub rule.) `except`
    clauses will still be handled correctly, but a message will be emitted
    encouraging users to update the syntax.

    (This change was made since the `except` syntax was misleading in that it
    (implied that the exception sequences were exceptions only to the rule at that
    (same statement, whereas in fact they are exceptions to all subsequent rules
    (until the end of the lookup.)

*   Value record, anchor, device, contour point, and caret values: changed to a
    consistent syntax that removes ambiguities and is more human-readable. (They
    are now enclosed within angle brackets; the `anchor`, `contourpoint`, and
    `caret` keywords are introduced; commas now separate device ppem/number
    pairs from each other.)

**Note:** Of the above changes, only value record format B in a Single Pos
statement is actually implemented. For example, `pos a 80 0 -160 0;` was changed
to `pos a <80 0 -160 0>;`. Previous syntax will still be handled correctly, but
a message will be emitted encouraging users to update the syntax.

*   Value records and anchors in GPOS rules (except for the AFM-style Pair Pos
    format) now immediately follow the glyphs they correspond to; no commas are
    needed. GDEF LigatureCaret statement: removed commas between caret values.
    (Implementation not affected, since these sections were implemented.)
*   Added ability to handle Single Sub rules with a single replacement glyph for
    2 or more glyphs in the target glyph class; e.g. `sub [one.fitted
    one.oldstyle one.tab.oldstyle] by one`.
*   Added support for named `lookupflag` attributes e.g.
    `lookupflag IgnoreLigatures;`.
*   Updated the OT layout algorithm pseudo-code.
*   Clarified that a pair positioning rule is treated as a class pair if and
    only if at least one glyph class is present, even if that class is a
    singleton glyph class.

**v1.1 [1 December 2000; HOT library v01.00.28]:**

*   Added support for `languagesystem` statement. Note that this entailed
    removing support for script, language, and named lookup blocks/statements
    in the `size` feature, and removing support for script and language
    statements in the `aalt` feature.
*   Added implementation note at end of Syntax: Glyph Classes section.
*   Updated OTL engine algorithm and lookup ordering section.
*   Specified that the `vmtx` table overrides are recorded in the `VORG` table
    as well.

**v1.0 [29 September 2000; HOT library v01.00.24]:**

*   Added useExtension keyword support for lookup blocks and the `aalt`
    feature block.

**v0.9 [25 April 2000; HOT library v01.00.23]:**

*   Added vmtx table keyword VertOriginY.
*   Changed description of `aalt` feature to describe sorting of alternate
    glyphs.
*   Added description of head.fontRevision setting and reporting.
*   Changed syntax for feature parameters.

**v0.8 [24 February 2000; HOT library v01.00.23]:**

*   Added syntax for feature parameters.
*   Various miscellaneous description changes.

**v0.7 [11 October 1999; HOT library v01.00.22]:**

*   Added grammar for completely specifying GSUB, GPOS, BASE and GDEF:
    full-fledged value records, device tables, anchors, required features,
    GPOS LookupTypes 3-6 and 8, generalized GSUB LookupType 6, subtable breaks.
    Indicated all parts not currently supported in [brackets].
*   `aalt` creation: specified that `aalt` will be created after all other
    features; special script rules.
*   Added OS/2.FSType, WeightClass and WidthClass overrides.
