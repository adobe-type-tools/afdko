Methods:
 - if the -rp option is used without a file name, read input from
   'current.fpr', and always save the final set of options.
 - if the -rp option is used with a file name, use those options,
   but save the final option.
 - save the current options only if requested with -sp, or if the
   file did not exist before.
 - override all options from a project file with any other options
   that are specified.
 - if the input font is not specified, look for, in order, 'font.ufo,
   'font.pfa', and cidfont.ps, all in the current directory.
 - if the FontMenuNameDB file is not specified look in:
      1) the current directory
      2) one up from the current
      3) two up from the current directory
      4) in afdko/resources

   Look up the file name based on R-O from a hard-coded table.

Project file
  This is a simple text file of key/value pairs, one pair per line. The
  keys may not contain white-space. The value is the remainder of the
  line. Boolean values are either 'true' or 'false'. Paths are UTF-8
  strings with whitespace removed from both ends. See the definitions
  below for the fields.
"""

__usage__ = __version__ + """
-f <input font>     Specify input font path. Default is to search
                    for 'font.ufo, 'font.pfa', and cidfont.ps, all in the
                    current directory.
                    When a UFO file is specified, makeotf will prefer glyphs
                    from the glyphs.com.adobe.type.processedglyphs layer, which
                    is created by checkoutlinesufo and/or autohint tools.

-o <output font>    Specify output font path. Default is
                    '<PostScript-Name>.otf'. If the path is an existing
                    folder, a default-named font will be saved to it.

-b                  Set style to Bold. Affects style-linking.
                    Default is not Bold

-nb                 Turn off the -b option, if it has previously
                    been turned on.

-i                  Set style to Italic. Affects style-linking.
                    Default is not Italic

-ni                 Turn off the -i option, if it has previously
                    been turned on.

-ff <feature file>  Specify path to feature file. Default is 'features';
                    'features.fea' is also accepted.

-fs                 Make stub GSUB table if there are no glyph substitution
                    rules in the features file.

-mf <FMNDB>         Specify path to FontMenuNameDB file.
                    Default is 'FontMenuNameDB'.

-gf <GOADB>         Specify path to GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.
                    Default is 'GlyphOrderAndAliasDB'. If this is
                    specified, and the -r or -ga options are NOT
                    specified, the effect is to use the Unicode
                    assignments from the third column of the GOADB
                    file without renaming the glyphs.

-r                  Set release mode. This turns on subroutinization,
                    applies the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file, and
                    removes the word "Development" from the name
                    table Version (name.ID=5) string.

-nr                 Set the option option -r off, if it has been
                    previously set.

-S                  Turn on subroutinization, a form of
                    compression of the CFF font data.

-nS                 Turn off subroutinization, if it has
                    previously been turned on.

-maxs <number>      Limit the number of subroutines generated by
                    glyph subroutinization to that number. Used for
                    testing with rasterizers that don't process
                    subroutinization correctly.

-ga                 Apply the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.

-nga                Turn off the -ga option, if it has previously
                    been turned on.

-gs                 Omit from the font any glyphs not mentioned in the
                    GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file.
                    Only works if -ga or -r is set.

-rev [version]      Without the optional version number, increments the
                    version number by 5. With an integer argument,
                    it increments the minor version by that
                    number. With a fractional argument, it sets
                    the version to the fractional argument; the
                    number must then be decimal with three decimal
                    places, e.g. '1.045', not '1.45'.

-oldNameID4         Set Windows name.ID=4 to the PS name, and Mac
                    name.ID=4 to Preferred Family + space +
                    Preferred Style name, as in all releases of
                    makeotf before Dec 2010.

-newNameID4         Set Windows and Mac name.ID=4 to Preferred
                    Family + space + Preferred Style name, as in
                    the current OpenType spec. This is the default
                    behavior, and is needed only to override a
                    fontinfo or project file setting.

-osbOn <number>     Set a bit to 'on' in the OS/2 table
                    fsSelection field at the specified bit index.

-osbOff <number>    Set a bit to 'off' in the OS/2 table
                    fsSelection field at the specified bit index.
                    Note: if any of the bits 7,8,9 are set on or
                    off, they must all three be explicitly
                    set. See "New OS/2 Bits" in the
                    "MakeOTFUserGuide.pdf" file.

-osv <number>       Set the OS/2 table version to the specified
                    value. Must be greater than 0. If no bits >6
                    are specified for the OS/2 table fsSelection
                    field, then the default version number is 3;
                    else the default is 4.

-addn               Replace the .notdef glyph in the source data
                    (if any) with a standard notdef glyph,
                    matching font weight and width.

-naddn              Turn off the -addn option, if it has previously
                    been turned on.

-adds               If the font is missing any of the Apple Mac
                    Symbol glyphs, create them, matching the font
                    weight and width.
                    Will be disabled for fonts without both a zero
                    and a lowercase 'x'.

-nadds              Turn off the -adds option, if it has previously
                    been turned on.

-serif              Specify that any added glyph use the serif
                    built-in multiple master glyph data.

-sans               Specify that any added glyphs will use the
                    sans-serif built-in multiple master glyph data.

-cs                 Override the heuristics, and specify the
                    ScriptID for the Macintosh 'cmap' subtable.

-cl                 Override the heuristics, and specify the
                    LanguageID for the Macintosh 'cmap' subtable.

-cm <path>          Path to the Macintosh CMap resource; CID-keyed
                    fonts only.

-ch <path>          Path to the UTF-32 CMap resource for horizontal
                    glyphs; CID-keyed fonts only.

-ci <path>          Path to the Unicode Variation Sequences
                    specification file; if present, a 'cmap'
                    subtable will be added with PlatformID = 0,
                    ScriptID = 5, and Format = 14. See MakeOTF User's Guide.

-dbl                For a short list of glyphs, double map them to
                    two Unicode values if there is no other glyph
                    mapped from the same Unicode value. This used to
                    be default behavior for makeotf. The glyph
                    list is as follows:

                    Delta (U+2206, U+0394)
                    Omega (U+2126, U+03A9)
                    Scedilla (U+015E, U+F6C1)
                    Tcommaaccent (U+0162, U+021A)
                    fraction (U+2044, U+2215)
                    hyphen (U+002D, U+00AD)
                    macron (U+00AF, U+02C9)
                    mu (U+00B5, U+03BC)
                    periodcentered (U+00B7, U+2219)
                    scedilla (U+015F, U+F6C2)
                    space (U+0020, U+00A00)
                    tcommaaccent (U+0163, U+021B)

-dcs                Set OS/2.DefaultChar to the Unicode value for
                    'space' rather than '.notdef'. The latter is
                    correct by the OT spec, but QuarkXPress 6.5
                    requires the former in order to print OTF/CFF
                    fonts.

-fi [<path>]        Path to the fontinfo file. If no path is given,
                    the default is to look for first 'fontinfo', then
                    'cidfontinfo', in the current directory. Used
                    to set some default values. This are
                    overridden by any conflicting settings in the
                    project file and then by command-line options.
                    This option is processed before any others, so
                    if the path is relative, it is relative to the
                    current working directory. All other relative
                    paths are relative so the source font's parent
                    directory.

-fp [<path>]        Path to the project file. If no path is given,
                    the default is 'current.fpr'; If used, it sets
                    default options that can be overridden by
                    command-line options.

-sp [<path>]        Save the current options to the project file
                    named in the "-fp" option; not needed unless
                    you specified a name other than 'current.fpr'.
                    If you supply the optional path argument, then
                    options are saved to that file.

-cn                 As a post-processing step, convert the CFF
                    table to a CID-keyed CFF that specifies the
                    Adobe-Identity-0 ROS. The resulting font
                    should be considered experimental, and may not
                    work in some applications.

-ncn                Turn off converting the CFF table to a CID-keyed
                    CFF that specifies the Adobe-Identity-0 ROS;
                    otherwise has no effect.

-shw/-nshw          Show/Hide warnings about unhinted glyphs.
                    This is useful when processing unhinted fonts.

-swo/-nswo          Suppress CFF width optimization (use of defaultWidthX
                    and nominalWidthX). Useful when poking at charstrings
                    with other tools.

-stubCmap4          Build only a "stub" Format 4 'cmap' subtable, with
                    only two segments. This is useful only for special-
                    purpose fonts such as AdobeBlank, whose size is an
                    issue. Windows requires a Format 4 'cmap' subtable
                    to be present, but it is not used.

-omitMacNames       Write only Windows platform menu names in name table,
                    apart from the names specified in the feature file.

-useMacNames        Write Mac platform menu names in name table,
                    as well as Windows names.

-overrideMenuNames  Allow feature file name table entries to override
                    default values and the values from the font menu name DB
                    for name IDs. Name ID's 2 and 6 cannot be overridden.
                    Use this with caution, and make sure you have provided
                    feature file name table entries for all platforms.

-skco/nskco         do/do not suppress kern class optimization by using
                    left side class 0 for non-zero kern values. Optimizing
                    saves a few hundred to thousand bytes, but confuses
                    some programs. Optimizing is the default behavior,
                    and previously was the only option.

-addDSIG,-omitDSIG  Add or omit minimal empty DSIG table. This is added
                    by default in release mode.

-V                  Show warnings about common, but usually not
                    problematic issues, such a glyph being unhinted,
                    or having conflicting GDEF classes because it is used in
                    more than one class type in a layout table. An example
                    is being used as a base glyph in one replacement rule,
                    and as a mark glyph in another.

-v                  Print the tool's version.

-showFinal          In error messages, show glyph final name rather
                    than source name.

Note that options are applied in the order in which they are
specified: "-r -nS" will not subroutinize a font, but "-nS -r" will
subroutinize a font. See the document 'MakeOTFUserGuide.pdf' for the
format and contents of the fontinfo and project files.

__help__ = __usage__ + """

makeotf parts.

makeotf now comes in two parts. One is the C program 'makeotfexe',
which requires that all input files be specified as command-line
parameters. This is the program that reads in all the data, and build
the final OpenType font. You can build OpenType fonts using only this
program.

The other part is the 'makeotf.py' Python script, which is invoked
indirectly by the command-shell script 'makeotf'. The script is a
wrapper for the 'makeotfexe', and does several useful things for you:

- Uses the 'tx' tool to convert the input font into the Unix Type 1
  format that is required by 'makeotfexe'.
- Saves the parameters used for makeotfexe in a project file. This can
  later be referenced by the single option '-fp', which saves a lot of
  typing. It also allows saving standard settings for release end
  development builds.
- verifies that the input files exist. This avoids crashes in
  makeotfexe.


Project files.

Every makeotf is run, it saves the options used to build the font
in a project file named "current.fpr". The font can be rebuilt with
exactly the same options by using the option -fp, or use most of
the options by following '-fp' with additional options to set
different parameters.

Note that if you specify a project file other than "current.fpr", the
final set of parameters used will not be saved to the project file
unless you also specify the "-sp" option.
