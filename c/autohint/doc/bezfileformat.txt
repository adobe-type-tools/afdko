	PROPOSAL FOR BEZIER FILE FORMATS (revised)

The Standard Bezier format is an encrypted file consisting of the following
operators:
  (width) -- character width (* this may be added at a later date)
   sc 	-- start of character outline
   rmt  -- relative move, same as T1 rmoveto operator)
   vmt  -- relative move, same as T1 vmoveto operator)
   hmt  -- relative move, same as T1 hmoveto operator)
   rdt  -- relative line/draw, same as T1 rlineto operator)
   vdt  -- relative line/draw, same as T1 vlineto operator)
   hdt  -- relative line/draw, same as T1 hlineto operator))
   rct  -- optimized relative curve, same as T1 rrcurveto operator)
   vhct  -- optimized relative curve, same as T1 vhcurveto operator)
   hvct  -- optimized relative curve, same as T1 hvcurveto operator))
   cp   -- end of sub-path, same as T1 closepath operator)
   ed   -- end of character outline, sa,e as T1 endchar operator.
   preflx1 -- marks start of flex op, expressed a s T1 path ops
   preflx2 -- marks end of flex op
   flx -- flex op.
   beginsubr snc -- marks start of new block of hint values
   endsubr enc<new line>newcolors -- marks end of hint values
   rb  -- horizontal stem hint
   ry -- vertical stem hint
   rm --  vertical counter hints
   rv -- horiztonal counter hints
   div -- same PostScript div operator.


Notes:
The preflx1/  preflx2 sequence provides the same info as the flex
sequence; the difference is that the preflx1/preflx2 sequence provides
the argument values needed for building a Type1 string while the flex
sequence is simply the 6 rcurveto points. Both sequences are always
provided.
