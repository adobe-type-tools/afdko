SOFTWARE RIGHTS

We reserve no LEGAL rights to the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool
Set (PCCTS) -- PCCTS is in the public domain.  An individual or
company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with
PCCTS or the code generated by PCCTS, including the incorporation of
PCCTS, or its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with PCCTS.  However, we do ask
that credit is given to us for developing PCCTS.  By "credit", we mean
that if you incorporate our source code into one of your programs
(commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
etc...  If you like PCCTS and have developed a nice tool with the
output, please mention that you developed it using PCCTS.  In
addition, we ask that this header remain intact in our source code.
As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing
this system and expect to make other tools available as they are
completed.
