                            ANTLR 1.33

This directory contains the files necessary to build ANTLR.

If you do a "make scrub", ANTLR will have to run on antlr.g and DLG
will have to run on parser.dlg.  Either

(1)     ANTLR uses the previous antlr in that directory to rebuild itself
(2)     Needs to find antlr on the search path

You will find that running "antlr -gh antlr.g" will result in about
10 ambiguity warnings.  These are normal.  Don't worry.

If you do a "make clean" right after installation, ANTLR and DLG should
not need to run; only the C files will compile.

Don't forget to go into the makefile to uncomment the appropriate
definitions for your OS/architecture/compiler or see the appropriate
NOTES.?? file.
