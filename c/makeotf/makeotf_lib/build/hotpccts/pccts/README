A central place for information about PCCTS 1.33 is:

        http://www.polhode.com/pccts.html

The maintenance release is available from:

        http://www.polhode.com/pccts133mr.zip

There is a ready-to-run version for win32 for Microsoft Visual Studio
at the same site.  It is available from:

        http://www.polhode.com/win32.zip

New users should visit http://www.polhode.com/pccts.html in
order to get the following document:

        "Notes For New Users of PCCTS"

This is a Postscript file of about 40 pages which is extremely 
useful for someone starting out. It is a based on 1.33mr21

When you have a little more experience, be sure to review the
following documents in the distribution kit:

            CHANGES_FROM_133.txt
            CHANGES_FROM_133_BEFORE_MR13.txt
            KNOWN_PROBLEMS.txt

                      INSTALLATION (Unix)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Download http://www.polhode.com/pccts133mr.zip

1. Unzip the distribution kit to your preferred location.  
   If there are newline problems try using zip -a ...

2. cd to the main pccts directory.

3. make

   This will create:

        antlr
        dlg
        sorcerer
        genmk

4. Copy to /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/bin if you like.  If you
   don't wish to then add pccts/bin to your path.

5. To get an up-to-date list of program options execute the
   program with no command line options.  To get up-to-date
   documentation read CHANGES_FROM_133*.txt and KNOWN_PROBLEMS.txt
   at:

           http://www.polhode.com/pccts.html

6. You need not create a library.  The makefile created by genmk
   assumes that the files are not part of a library. 

   If you wish to create a library from elements of pccts/h:

   If the first letter of the filename is lowercase (uppercase) it is
   related to the code generated using the pccts C mode (C++ mode).
   Some of the .c and .cpp files in the h directory are not meant to
   be placed in a library and will not compile because they are meant
   to be #include in pccts generated files which are grammar specific.

   For C++ users place the following elements in the library:

        AParser.cpp
        ASTBase.cpp
        ATokenBuffer.cpp
        BufFileInput.cpp (optional)
        DLexerBase.cpp
        PCCTSAST.cpp
        SList.cpp

                    INSTALLATION (Win32)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've tried to keep the win32 kit to the minimum necessary to get 
up and running.  The complete kit contains additional information
(some historical), source code, and DevStudio projects for 
rebuilding pccts from the source code.

The kit is now distributed with both MSVC 5 and MSVC6 style projects.

        http://www.polhode.com/KNOWN_PROBLEMS.txt

1. Unzip the distribution kit to your preferred location.

   This will create:

         a pccts directory tree
            pccts/bin/*.exe
            pccts/lib/*.lib
            pccts/h/*
            sorcerer/lib/*
            sorcerer/h/*

         an example directory tree
            pccts\example\calcAST\*
            pccts\example\simple\*

2. Define the environment variable PCCTS to point to the main
   pccts directory.

3. Try building the simple project: pccts\example\simple\simple50.dsw
   or simple60.dsw.

4. Try building the complex project: pccts\example\calcAST\calcAST50.dsw
   or calcAST60.dsw.

0. Download http://www.polhode.com/pccts133mr.zip

1. Unzip the distribution kit to your preferred location.

2. set default to the main pccts directory.

3. @makefile.vms

   This will create in directory [.bin]:

        antlr.exe
        dlg.exe
        sorcerer.exe
        genmk.exe

5. To get an up-to-date list of program options execute the
   program with no command line options.  To get up-to-date
