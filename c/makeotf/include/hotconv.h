/* Hatch OpenType (HOT) Font Conversion Library
   ============================================

   2021 Note
   ---------

   The original design of this library anticipated its use in a broad variety
   of contexts and with differently organized source materials. It has turned
   out that it is mainly or exclusively used by the AFDKO makeotfexe program.

   As one consequence the 2021 reorganization of the code has eliminated
   some of the now-unneeded encapsulation of the library. The memory allocation
   callbacks have been removed and the feature files are opened from within
   the library. Contributors should feel free to make further changes along
   the same lines if and when they reduce the complexity of fixing bugs or
   adding new features.

   Overview
   --------
   This library converts platform independent font data (PostScript outline
   font, menu names, metric information, etc) into an OpenType Format (OTF)
   font. Outline font data must be stripped of its platform-specific formatting
   bytes which involves the removal of segment headers from Windows PFB fonts
   or unpacking of POST resources from Macintosh FFIL files. (The removal of
   eexec and charstring encryption is handled internally by the library.) The
   library supports single master, multiple master, synthetic, and CID-keyed
   fonts by auto-detection, obviating the need for the client to specify the
   font type prior to conversion.

   This library is initialized with a single call to hotNew() which allocates a
   opaque context (hotCtx) which is passed to subsequent functions and is
   destroyed by a single call to hotFree(). Thus, multiple contexts may be
   concurrently allocated permitting operation in a multi-threaded environment.

   Once a context has been allocated a client must call hotReadFont() to read
   the PostScript outline font. This function returns information about the
   font including: FontName, font type: single master, multiple master, or CID,
   and font encoding. The FontName may be used for OTF filename generation. The
   font type may be used to determine which metric file should be subsequently
   read, e.g. choose .MMM instead of .PFM for multiple master fonts on the
   Windows platform. The encoding may be used to decide which encoding to use
   for decoding the kerning data.

   Next, the client must provide information that does not reside in the
   outline font file. This would normally be derived from a metrics file or
   resource. Menu name information is added first by calling hotAddName(), then
   miscellaneous data by hotAddMiscData(). Subsequently, optional kerning data
   may be added by calls to hotAddKernPair(), hotAddKernValue(), and
   hotAddUnencChar().

   If the client wishes to add tables to the OTF file which are not supported
   directly by the hot library, they may be added at this step by calling
   hotAddAnonTable() for each table to be added. If the specifications for the
   anonymous tables are in the feature file (which is read in by the library
   during hotConvert()), then calls to hotAddAnonTable() may also be made
   within the featAddAnonData() callbacks. See the documentation for the
   featAddAnonData() callback below for further details.

   When all additional information has been provided to the library the
   conversion is initiated by a single call to hotConvert(). Thus, a typical
   single master conversion follows the following call sequence.

   ctx = hotNew(...);
   hotSetConvertFlags(ctx, hotConvFlags) // set flags before any hot unctions are called.
   FontName = hotReadFont(ctx, ...);
   hotAddName(ctx, ...);       // repeat for each name
   hotAddMiscData(ctx, ...);
   hotAddKernPair(ctx, ...);   // repeat for each pair
   hotAddKernValue(ctx, ...);  // repeat for each value
   hotConvert(ctx);
   hotFree(ctx);

   CJK fonts must specify horizontal and (optional) vertical Unicode
   information, as well as Macintosh encoding information. This is introduced
   by calls to hotAddCMap(). Thus, a CJK conversion has the following call
   sequence.

   ctx = hotNew(...);
   hotSetConvertFlags(ctx, hotConvFlags) // set flags before any hot unctions are called.
   FontName = hotReadFont(ctx, ...);
   hotAddName(ctx, ...);       // repeat for each name
   hotAddMiscData(ctx, ...);
   hotAddCMap(ctx, ...);
   hotAddCMap(ctx, ...);
   hotAddCMap(ctx, ...);
   hotConvert(ctx);
   hotFree(ctx);

   During conversion the font data is processed by a number of steps.

   1. PostScript font data is read from the client, parsed, partially converted
      to CFF, and stored in memory.
   2. During step 1 the client may optionally choose (by providing the
      appropriate callback functions) that a temporary file be created for
      storing the partially converted data in order to reduce memory
      requirements.
   3. The partially converted data from step 1 is assembled into a CFF font and
      written back to the client. The client has the option of receiving the
      CFF font data size before writing begins so that a memory buffer for it
      may be pre-allocated.
   4. The CFF data is randomly read back from the client in order to extract
      font-wide and glyph-specific data from the font.
   5. The OTF data is written to the client. Part of this process involves
      copying the CFF data into the 'CFF ' table in the OTF font.
   6. The OTF data is randomly read back, table checksums are calculated, and
      the sfnt directory is updated.

   The sequence of calls between hotReadFont() and hotConvert() inclusive, may
   be repeated to convert more than one font using the same context. The types
   of fonts (single master, multiple master, and CID) converted in this manner
   may be freely intermixed. This approach is more efficient than allocating
   and destroying a context for each converted font. */

typedef struct hotCtx_ *hotCtx; /* Opaque library context */
typedef struct hotCallbacks_ hotCallbacks;

hotCtx hotNew(hotCallbacks *cb);

/* hotNew() initializes the library and returns an opaque context that is
   subsequently passed to all the other library functions. It must be the first
   function in the library to be called. The client passes a set of callback
   functions to the library via the cb argument which is a hotCallbacks data
   structure whose fields are described below. Optional fields should be passed
   with a NULL value if not required.

   Five sets of I/O callback functions are required during conversion.
   Functions within each set have the same name prefix, as follows:

   ps   PostScript font data
   cff  CFF font data
   otf  OTF font data
   feat Feature file data
   tmp  Optional temporary font data used during CFF conversion

   A client is free to choose any I/O implementation that supports the I/O
   callbacks, for example:

   o File-based I/O using standard functions: fopen(), fclose(), fread(),
     fwrite(), putc(), ftell(), and fseek()
   o Memory-based I/O using dynamically allocated memory
   o Memory-mapped I/O using virtual memory support provided by the system

   It is important (for performance reasons) for a client to choose an input
   buffer size that isn't too small. For file-based clients a buffer size of
   BUFSIZ would be a good choice because it will match the underlying low-level
   system input functions. */

/* Message types (for use with message callback) */
enum {
    hotHEADING,
    hotNOTE,
    hotWARNING,
    hotERROR,

   multi-threaded environments.

   Exception handling: */

    void (*fatal)(void *ctx);

    /* [Required] fatal() is an exception handler that is called if an
   unrecoverable error is encountered during conversion. The client should
   immediately call hotFree() to release the current context. This function
   must NOT return and the client should use longjmp() to return control to a
   point prior to calling tcNew(). */

    void (*message)(void *ctx, int type, const char *text); /* (optional) */

    /* [Optional] message() simply passes a message back to the client as a

    char *(*psId)(void *ctx);

    /* [Optional] psId() should provide a way of identifying the source of the

   client must arrange that successive calls to psRefill() return consecutive
   blocks of data starting with the first byte in the font. (A file-based
   client might map this function to fread() and fill buffers of BUFSIZ bytes.)

   CFF data input/output: */

    char *(*cffId)(void *ctx);

    /* [Optional] cffId() should provide a way of identifying the destination of
   the CFF data that is produced during conversion. This would typically be a

    void (*cffWriteN)(void *ctx, long count, char *ptr);

    /* [Required] These functions are called to handle the output of a single byte

    char *(*cffSeek)(void *ctx, long offset, long *count);

    /* [Required] cffSeek() is called in order to seek to an absolute position in
   the CFF data specified by the offset parameter. It returns a pointer to the
   new data (beginning at that offset) and the count of the number of bytes of

   by checking that the offset lies within the data region. (A file-based

   permits a memory-based client to allocate the exact amount of space for the

   Euro glyph was automatically added to the font; otherwise, it is set to 0.

    /* [Required, except for otfId()] These functions are identical to the
   similarly named cff functions except that the operate on OTF data and
   otfSeek just performs positioning and doesn't return data.

   otfSeek() returns the current offset in the OTF data (relative to its start
   at offset 0). (A file-based client would typically map this to function to
   ftell().)

   Feature file data input: */

    char *(*featTopLevelFile)(void *ctx);
    void (*featAddAnonData)(void *ctx, const char *data, long count,
                            unsigned long tag);

    /* [Required] These functions are called to handle feature file support.
   featTopLevelFile() should return a relative or absolute path (which need
   only be valid for the length of the call) to the top-level feature file
   or NULL if there is no file.
   
   featAddAnonData() is called at the end of every anonymous block in the
   feature file. It supplies a pointer to the data seen within the block (from
   the beginning of the line after the opening brace and up to the end of the
   line, including the newline, before the closing brace) and a count of the
   number of bytes of data available. The data is guaranteed to be valid only
   for the duration of the function call. The tag argument indicates the tag
   associated with the anonymous block in the feature file. Anonymous blocks
   typically contain information needed to specify OTF tables that the hot
   library does not directly support. In these cases, the client must add the
   anonymous tables by calls to hotAddAnonTable() within the duration of the
   featAddAnonData() callbacks.

   Anon blocks are now deprecated in the spec and makeotfexe does nothing with
   them.

   Temporary file I/O (all optional) */

    void (*tmpOpen)(void *ctx);

    /* [Optional] These functions are called to handle large CID-keyed fonts when
   memory is at a premium. If tmpOpen() is non-NULL the library will use these
   functions to reduce memory requirements. The idea behind this mode is that
   rather than keep entire fonts in memory they are accumulated in a temporary
   file that is re-read during the output of the CFF data. (A client might map
   these functions onto tmpfile(), fwrite(), rewind() or fseek(), fread(), and
   fclose(), respectively.) */

    char *(*getFinalGlyphName)(void *ctx, char *gname);

     Macintosh Standard Roman encoding and hotMacData.encoding is set to NULL.
   o Macintosh fonts with unusual encoding require that the "use non-standard
     Macintosh reencoding" bit in the FontClass be set and a font reencoding be
     specified in the FOND. In these cases, hotCommonData.encoding should be
     set to NULL and the reencoding found in the FOND should be be passed via
     hotMacData.encoding. Unused elements of the encoding array should be set
     to NULL. The library will layer the reencoding onto the PostScript
     encoding to recreate the Macintosh encoding.
   o If neither of the FontClass bits mentioned above are set, then both
     encoding fields should be set to NULL.

   For a Windows conversion:
   o If the font needs to be reencoded to a standard Windows code page,
     typically indicated by a charset that has a value other than symbol
     charset, then that Windows code page should be passed in via
     hotCommonData.encoding. If the PostScript encoding of the font is to be
     used, hotCommonData.encoding should be set to NULL.
   o If the font uses a non-standard Macintosh reencoding when used on the
     Macintosh, the entire Macintosh encoding (not just the reencoding that
     would have been in the FOND) should be passed via the hotMacData.encoding
     field. The client would typically access this information from a font
     conversion database. */

   values are unknown to the client in which case the library will attempt to
   set the values from inspection of other data values.

   The CharSet field specifies the windows charset for this font. (See Windows

   pfm.CharSet. Also see description of the Family field.

   The DefaultChar should be set from pfm.FirstChar + pfm.DefaultChar. The

   on the Windows platform to Unicode by adding a high byte of 0. 2-byte
   Unicode values for the Windows platform may be specified using a special
   character sequence of a backslash character (\) followed by exactly four
   hexadecimal numbers (of either case) which may not all be zero, e.g. \4e2d .
   The ASCII backslash character must be represented as the sequence \005c .

   character sequence of a backslash character (\) followed by exactly two
   hexadecimal numbers (of either case) which may not both be zero, e.g. \83 .

   The special notations described above aren't needed for Latin fonts because
   their menu names have traditionally been restricted to ASCII characters
   only. However, the special notations are required for CJK fonts where menu
   names are typically composed of characters outside of the usual ASCII range.
