/* UFO Font Format Generation Library
   =====================================

   This library supports the generation of UFO fonts from an abstract font.

   This library is initialized with a single call to ufwNew() which allocates a
   opaque context (ufwCtx) which is passed to subsequent functions and is
   destroyed by a single call to ufwFree(). Thus, multiple contexts may be
   concurrently allocated permitting operation in a multi-threaded environment.

   Once a context has been allocated a client may call other functions in the
   interface in order to generate the desired font.

   Memory management and stream I/O are implemented via two sets of
   client-supplied callback functions passed to ufwNew(). I/O is performed on
   two abstract data streams:

   o UFO font data (w)
   o debug diagnostics (w)

   These streams are managed by a single set of client callback functions
   enabling the client to choose from a wide variety of implementation schemes
   ranging from disk files to memory buffers. The temporary stream is used to
   keep the run-time memory usage within reasonable limits when handling large
   fonts.

   Glyph data is passed to the library via the set of glyph callback functions
   defined in ufwGlyphCallbacks. */

   subsequently passed to all the other library functions. It must be the first
   function in the library to be called by the client. The client passes sets
   of memory and stream callback functions (described in ctlshare.h) to the
   library via the "mem_cb" and "stm_cb" parameters.

   The UFW_CHECK_ARGS macro is passed as the last parameter to ufwNew() in
   order to perform a client/library compatibility check. */

   by ufwNew().

   Clients need to be aware that certain values are not valid in an XML 1.0 file.
   Because of this the library will skip glyphs that have a unicode value
   that is equal to an invalid character.  These include all control chars (values
