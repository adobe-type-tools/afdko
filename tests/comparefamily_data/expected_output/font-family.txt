Family Test 13: Check that no two faces in a preferred group have the same weight/width/Italic-style values when the OS/2 table fsSelection bit 8 (WEIGHT_WIDTH_SLOPE_ONLY) is set.

Family Test 14: Check that all faces in a preferred group have the same fsType embedding values.

Family Test 15: Check that all faces in a preferred group have the same underline position and width.

Family Test 16: Check that for all faces in a preferred family group, that the width of any glyph is not more than 3 times the width of the same glyph in any other face.

Family Test 17: Check that fonts have OS/2 table version 4.
	Warning: The font Font-Quadratic should have an OS/2 table version of at least 4 instead of 3.
	Warning: The font Font-Rectangular should have an OS/2 table version of at least 4 instead of 3.

Family Test 18: Check that all faces in a Compatible Family group have the same array size of BlueValues and OtherBlues within a Compatible Family Name Italic or Regular sub-group of the family.

Family Test 19: Check that all faces in the Preferred Family group have the same values of FamilyBlues and FamilyOtherBlues, and are valid.
	Warning. The fonts in the family group Font do not have  FamilyBlue values. This font feature helps with alignment of different styles of the same family on a text line.

Family Test 20: Check that all faces in the Compatible Family group have the same BlueScale value.

FamilyTest 21: Check that all faces in the Compatible Family group have the same BlueShift value.
