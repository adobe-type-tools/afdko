Number of preferred families: 1 ['Source Code Pro']
Number of font faces: 14


Single Face Test 1: Length overrun check for name ID 18. Max 63 characters, must be unique within 31 chars.

Single Face Test 2: Length overrun check for name ID's 1,2, 4, 16, 17. Max 63 characters.

Single Face Test 3: Check that name ID 4 (Full Name) starts with same string as Preferred Family Name, and is the same as the CFF font Full Name.

Single Face Test 4: Version name string matches release font criteria and head table value

Single Face Test 5: Check that CFF PostScript name is same as name table name ID 6.

Single Face Test 6: Check that Copyright, Trademark, Designer note, and foundry values are present, and match default values.
	Error: Environment variable CF_DEFAULT_URL is not set, so I can't compare it to  Mac Foundry URL name id 11.
	Error: Environment variable CF_DEFAULT_FOUNDRY_CODE is not set, so I can't compare it to  the OS/2 table foundry code.

Single Face Test 7: Checking for deprecated CFF operators.

Single Face Test 8: Check SubFamily Name (name ID 2) for  Regular Style, Bold Style, Italic Style, and BoldItalic Style

Single Face Test 9: Check that no OS/2.usWeightClass is less than 250
	Error: OS/2.usWeightClass is 200 for Font SourceCodePro-ExtraLight 
This may cause the font glyphs to be smear-bolded under Windows 2000.
	Error: OS/2.usWeightClass is 200 for Font SourceCodePro-ExtraLightIt 
This may cause the font glyphs to be smear-bolded under Windows 2000.

Single Face Test 10: Check that no Bold Style face has OS/2.usWeightClass of less than 500

Single Face Test 11: Check that BASE table exists, and has reasonable values

Single Face Test 12: Check that Italic style is set when post table italic angle is non-zero, and that italic angle is reasonable.

Single Face Test 13: Warn if post.isFixedPitch is set when font is not monospaced.
